## ðŸ”’ Why This Happens
- Google requires app verification for public OAuth apps
- Unverified apps can only be used by the developer and approved test users
- Creating your own project bypasses this limitation

## âœ… Benefits of Your Own Project
- Full control over API quotas
- No dependency on external projects
- Can publish immediately without verification delays
- Can add other users as needed

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps
1. Create your own Google Cloud project following the steps above
2. Download your own credentials file
3. Replace the existing `youtube_credentials.json`
4. Run the upload command again

The whole process takes about 5-10 minutes!
