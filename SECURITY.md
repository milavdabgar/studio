## Security Policy

We take security seriously and appreciate responsible disclosures.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
- Submit privately via GitHub Security Advisories: https://github.com/milavdabgar/studio/security/advisories/new
- Include: impact, affected areas (files/routes), reproduction steps, logs (redacted), and suggested remediation if known.
- Do not open a public issue or PR for vulnerabilities.

## Acknowledgement & Timelines
- We acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide a triage status.
- Fix timelines depend on severity; critical issues are prioritized.

## Scope & Examples
- In scope: auth/session flaws, data exposure, injection (XSS/SQLi/NoSQLi), SSRF, privilege escalation, CSRF, broken access control.
- Out of scope: DDoS, rate limiting tests on production, clickjacking on non-sensitive pages, UI typos, reports without a clear security impact.

## Safe Harbor
We will not pursue action against researchers making a good‑faith effort to comply with this policy and avoid privacy violations or service disruption.
