## 1. Rationale

Electrical, Electronic, Instrumentation and allied engineering diploma holders are required to use
and maintain various types of electronically controlled equipment. The fundamental principles of
electronics are to be applied in most of the situations to arrive at the probable solutions which is
faced in the world of work, therefore the knowledge of the functions of various basic electronic
devices and components and practical skills acquired through the laboratory experiments will
help them, when they work with electronic equipment and its sub-circuits. This course is
designed to develop the skills to use the basics electronic components and apply the knowledge
to maintain the various types of electronic circuits.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- To maintain various electronics circuits and implement related applications.
## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
- Practice environment friendly methods and processes.
- Follow safety precautions.
The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
     ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
     iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and

Electronic Circuits & Applications                                                Course Code: 4321104

prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
-      Prepare a table and interpret the technical specification of various diodes and
transistors using data sheet.
ii.     Compare specifications of various voltage regulator ICs.
iii.     Prepare a survey report of different heat sinks used in electronic devices/instruments
and list out the alternatives used for heat sinks.
iv.      Undertake a market survey of Different types of Amplifiers.
-      Prepare labeled chart of SMPS and UPS.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students to find different ICs used in real time application based on diodes and
transistors.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Transistor Amplifier: a common emitter amplifier using transistor and prepare a mini
       project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Transistors Application: Build any application based on transistor and prepare a mini

- Diodes Application: Build basic applications using any one or combination of diodes,
        and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Opto devices: Build an automatic power saving street light controller circuit using opto
        devices and prepare a mini project report( Duration 6-8 hours).
- Battery Chargers: Build a mobile/USB battery charger using solar cell.
