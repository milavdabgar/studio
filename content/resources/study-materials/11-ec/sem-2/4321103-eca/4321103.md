## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- i. Prepare a table and interpret the technical specification of various diodes and transistors using data sheet.
- ii. Compare specifications of various voltage regulator ICs.
- iii. Prepare a survey report of different heat sinks used in electronic devices/instruments and list out the alternatives used for heat sinks.
- iv. Undertake a market survey of Different types of Amplifiers.
- v. Prepare labeled chart of SMPS and UPS.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- f) Guide students to find different ICs used in real time application based on diodes and transistors.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Transistor Amplifier: a common emitter amplifier using transistor and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- b) Transistors Application: Build any application based on transistor and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- c) Diodes Application: Build basic applications using any one or combination of diodes, and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- d) Opto devices: Build an automatic power saving street light controller circuit using opto devices and prepare a mini project report( Duration 6-8 hours).
- e) Battery Chargers: Build a mobile/USB battery charger using solar cell.
