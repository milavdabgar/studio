    B --> C[Increased Ic]
    C --> D[More Power Dissipation]
    D --> A
    E[Thermal Stability Methods] --> F[Break this cycle]
```

**Thermal Runaway:**

- **Operating Principle**: Voltage at R2 sets base bias, remains stable despite β variations
- **Advantage**: Most stable biasing technique with excellent temperature compensation
- **Formula**: Base voltage VB = Vcc × (R2/(R1+R2))
- **Stability**: High stability factor as base voltage is nearly independent of collector current

**Mnemonic:** "DIVE for stability - Divider Is Very Effective for temperature and β variations"
