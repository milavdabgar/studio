## Note

- i. More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a suggestive list .
- ii. Care must be taken in assigning and assessing study report as it is a first year study report. Study report, data collection and analysis report must be assigned in a group. Teacher has to discuss about type of data (which and why) before group start their market survey.

The  following  are  some sample 'Process' and  'Product'  related skills  (more  may  be added/deleted depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises of this course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this course competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.
- c) Follow safety precautions.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- I.  Read  and  note  down  specifications  of  Digital  ICs  using  data  sheet:  IC  number/  Pin Diagram/voltage levels, applications for the following Digital ICs (TTL/CMOS): AND, OR, NOT, NAND,  NOR,  EX-OR,  EX-NOR  gates,  Decoder,  Multiplexer,  BCD  to  7-segment  decoder,  SR FF,JK FF, D FF, shift Register, Counter, ADC, DAC.
- ii. Solve  real  life  problems  using  binary  logic  theory  and  implement  it  using  digital  logic circuits.
- iii. Explore working of Digital clock/Digital panel.
- iv. Prepare micro project using Various Digital IC and display devices.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive  open  online  courses  ( MOOCs )  may  be  used  to  teach  various  topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessedusing different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- f) Introduce E-waste recycling technology among the students.

- g) Internet based home assignments
- h) Micro projects (in group of three to four students)

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Implement Logic Gates on General Purpose Board.
- b) Implement  simplified  Product  of  Sum  (POS)  based  equation  using  logic  gates  on General Purpose Board.
- c) Design Half Adder/Full Adder Circuit on General Purpose Board.
- d) Design Half Subtractor/Full Subtractor Circuit on General Purpose Board.
- e) Design 4:1 Multiplexer on General Purpose Board.
- f) Design 4 bit Gray to Binary code converter on General Purpose Board.
- g) Design any Flip-flop on General Purpose Board.
- h) Design 4-bit Counter on General Purpose Board.
- i) Identify Various types of Memories like Pen Drive, Hard Disk, DVD, Memory Card etc. around you and Prepare a chart of it.
- j) Identify E-Waste of Digital ICs and Prepare a brief Report of Remedies for it.
