## 1. Rationale

Digital technology is the fastest growing technology and have revolutionized the electronics
Industry. In most of the applications digital technology has replaced analogue technology.
Digital logic is heart of digital electronic circuits. A basic understanding of this subject is
therefore essential to effectively maintain digital electronic devices. The study of this course
will enable the students to test the working and rectify the faults of common digital circuits.

## 2. Competency

The course content should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop different
types of skills so that students are able to acquire following competency:
- Maintain the digital electronic circuits.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of
the following COs:
- Interpret various number systems and their conversions with binary arithmetic
operations.
- Implement simplified Boolean equations using logic gates.
- Test different types of combinational logic circuits.
- Test different types of sequential logic circuits.
- Classify various memories and logic families.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
     ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
     iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised
Bloom’s taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If
required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of
- Os and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
I. Read and note down specifications of Digital ICs using data sheet: IC number/ Pin
Diagram/voltage levels, applications for the following Digital ICs (TTL/CMOS): AND, OR, NOT,
- AND, NOR, EX-OR, EX-NOR gates, Decoder, Multiplexer, BCD to 7-segment decoder, SR
- F,JK FF, D FF, shift Register, Counter, ADC, DAC.
ii. Solve real life problems using binary logic theory and implement it using digital logic
circuits.
iii. Explore working of Digital clock/Digital panel.
iv. Prepare micro project using Various Digital IC and display devices.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessedusing
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Introduce E-waste recycling technology among the students.

- Internet based home assignments
- Micro projects (in group of three to four students)

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

```
which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Implement Logic Gates on General Purpose Board.
- Implement simplified Product of Sum (POS) based equation using logic gates on
- Design Half Adder/Full Adder Circuit on General Purpose Board.
- Design Half Subtractor/Full Subtractor Circuit on General Purpose Board.
- Design 4:1 Multiplexer on General Purpose Board.
- Design 4 bit Gray to Binary code converter on General Purpose Board.
- Design any Flip-flop on General Purpose Board.
- Design 4-bit Counter on General Purpose Board.
- Identify Various types of Memories like Pen Drive, Hard Disk, DVD, Memory Card
             etc. around you and Prepare a chart of it.
- Identify E-Waste of Digital ICs and Prepare a brief Report of Remedies for it.
