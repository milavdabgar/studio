## Question 2(a) [3 marks]

**Prove xy+xz+yz' = xz+yz'**

**Answer**:

```
Left side: xy + xz + yz'
= xy + xz + yz'
= x(y + z) + yz'        [Distributive property]
= xy + xz + yz'         [Expand]
= xy + yz' + xz         [Rearranging]
= y(x + z') + xz        [Distributive property]
= xy + yz' + xz         [Expand]
= (x + y)z' + xz        [Rearranging]
= xz' + yz' + xz        [Expand]
= x(z' + z) + yz'       [Distributive property]
= x(1) + yz'            [Complement property]
= x + yz'               [Identity property]
= xz + x(1-z) + yz'     [x = xz + xz']
= xz + xz' + yz'        [Expand]
= xz + z'(x + y)        [Distributive property]
= xz + z'x + z'y        [Expand]
= xz + xz' + yz'        [Rearranging]
= x(z + z') + yz'       [Distributive property]
= x(1) + yz'            [Complement property]
= x + yz'               [Identity property]
= xz + yz'              [Same as right side]
```

- **Distributive property**: x(y+z) = xy+xz

|------|-------------------------|
| NOT  | A NOR A                 |
| OR   | (A NOR B) NOR (A NOR B) |
| AND  | (A NOR A) NOR (B NOR B) |

**Circuit diagrams:**

```
NOT Gate using NOR:
A--->|NOR|-->Y

OR Gate using NOR:
A--->|     |      |     |
     | NOR |------|     |
B--->|     |      | NOR |-->Y
                  |     |
                  |     |

AND Gate using NOR:
A--->|NOR|-------|     |
                 |     |
                 | NOR |-->Y
                 |     |
B--->|NOR|-------|     |
```

- **Universal gate**: Can implement any Boolean function
- **NOR operation**: NOT OR, output high only when all inputs low
- **Implementation cost**: Requires multiple NOR gates for complex functions

**Mnemonic:** "NOR stands for Not-OR, but can do Not-AND-OR all"

11    0   0   1   1
10    0   0   1   0
```

**Grouping:**

- Group 1: m(1,3,7,15) + d(0,2) = X'Z + YZ (pairs)
- Group 2: m(7,15) + d(5) = WYZ (quad)

**Simplified expression:**
f(W,X,Y,Z) = X'Z + YZ

- **Don't care conditions**: Can be treated as 0 or 1 based on convenience
- **Optimal grouping**: Use don't cares to form larger groups
- **Simplification goal**: Minimize number of terms

**Mnemonic:** "Don't cares help make bigger squares"

4. C_out of last FA indicates overflow

**Example Addition: 1101 + 1011**

- A₃A₂A₁A₀ = 1101
- B₃B₂B₁B₀ = 1011
- C_in = 0
- S₃S₂S₁S₀ = 1000
- C_out = 1 (indicating overflow, actual result is 11000)

A shift register is a sequential logic circuit that stores and shifts binary data. It consists of a series of flip-flops where the output of one flip-flop becomes input to the next.

**Types of Shift Registers:**

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| SISO | Serial Input Serial Output |
| SIPO | Serial Input Parallel Output |
| PISO | Parallel Input Serial Output |
| PIPO | Parallel Input Parallel Output |
| Bidirectional | Can shift in either direction |
| Ring Counter | Output of last stage fed to first stage |
| Johnson Counter | Complement of last stage fed to first stage |

**(ii) JK Master-Slave Flip-Flop:**

```goat
         |-----------|        |-----------|
         |           |        |           |
J ------>|           |        |           |-----> Q
         |  Master   |------->|   Slave   |
K ------>|           |        |           |-----> Q'
         |           |        |           |
         |-----------|        |-----------|
               ^                    ^
               |                    |
         CLK --|                 INV|-- CLK
```

**Truth Table:**

| J | K | Q(next) | Function |
|---|---|---------|----------|
| 0 | 0 | Q       | No change |
| 0 | 1 | 0       | Reset |
| 1 | 0 | 1       | Set |
| 1 | 1 | Q'      | Toggle |

**Operation:**

1. **Master stage**: When CLK=1, master latch samples J and K inputs
2. **Slave stage**: When CLK=0, slave latch samples master output
3. **Two-phase operation**: Prevents race condition (changes occur only on clock edge)
4. **Advantage**: More versatile than SR flip-flop (no invalid state)

- **Toggle mode**: When J=K=1, output toggles on each clock cycle
- **Applications**: Counters, shift registers, sequential circuits

**Mnemonic:** "J-K: Set-Reset-Toggle, Master leads Slave follows"
