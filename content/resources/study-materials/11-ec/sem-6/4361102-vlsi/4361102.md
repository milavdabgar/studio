Semester-VI

Course Title: VLSI
- Course Code: 4361102)

Diploma programme in which this course is offered              Semester in which offered
Electronics & Communication                                     6th

## 1. Rationale

Digital integrated circuits are integral part of electronic equipment/gadgets starting from small
toys to complex computer systems including personal digital assistants, mobile phones and
Multimedia agents. This course will enable the students to acquire the basic skills to develop
codes for VLSI circuits through Verilog programming and the fabrication process. This
course will also enable them to use FPGA and ASIC chips for design and development of
various applications. Thus this course is an advance but very useful course for electronic
engineers.

## 2. Competency

The course content should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop required skills
in the students so that they are able to acquire following competency:
- Develop Verilog programs for VLSI based electronic systems

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The theory should be taught and practical should be undertaken in such a manner that
students are able to acquire required learning outcomes in cognitive, psychomotor and
affective domains to demonstrate the following course outcomes:
I.   Describe working of MOSFET system
- I.   Maintain MOS inverters
- II.   Maintain MOS circuits
- V.     Describe fabrication process for MOS
V.    Develop VERILOG Programs for combinational and sequential circuits

achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should
gradually increase as planned below:

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and
teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus
on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular
activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this
course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of each activity.
- Prepare chart to represent the CMOS design process
ii. Prepare chart to represent the technological advancements in CMOS technology starting from
transistors to current technology
iii. Project- Build a small ASIC for your Home /Community.
iv. Prepare chart showing the types of FPGA technology
- List out methods used in industries for each step used in CMOS design process.

## 11. Suggested Special Instructional Strategies

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:
- Show Video/ Animation film explaining VLSI Design which are available on internet.
ii. Arrange expert lecture on VHDL programming for real life applications.
iii. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
iv. Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine
- Visit industries where equipment/gadgets using VLSI are being manufactured/ assembled.
vii. Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.

## 12. Suggested Project List

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-
based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that
s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be
formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

Course Code: 4361102

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are

```
 in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work
 diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it
 before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen)
 student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the
 end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs.
Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.

- ICRO PROJECT 1: Prepare following Items.
```

1. Prepare graph showing relationship between feature size, number of transistors and year.

- ICRO PROJECT 2: Design Application oriented basic Project using FPGA.
1. Design and Implement LED flasher circuit.
2. Design and Implement circuit for relay-based operation using switch.
3. Design and Implement Room Temperature Monitor/Controller System.
4. Design and Implement Water Level Indicator/controller circuit

- ICRO PROJECT 3: Prepare following Items.
1. Prepare chart indicating the types of etching processes used with its application.
2. Prepare chart indicating the deposition processes with its application.
3. Prepare a survey report on the types of transistors used in memory elements.
4. Prepare a survey report on requirements of clean room and its classification
