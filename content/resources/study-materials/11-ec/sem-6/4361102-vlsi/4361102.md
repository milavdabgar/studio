## Course Title: VLSI

(Course Code: 4361102)

| Diploma programme in which this course is offered   | Semester in which offered   |
|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|

## 1. RATIONALE

Digital  integrated  circuits are  integral part  of electronic  equipment/gadgets starting from small toys to complex computer systems including personal digital assistants, mobile phones and Multimedia agents. This course will enable the students to acquire the basic skills to develop codes  for  VLSI  circuits  through Verilog programming  and  the  fabrication  process.  This course will also enable them to use FPGA and ASIC chips for design and development of various  applications.  Thus  this  course  is  an  advance  but  very  useful  course  for  electronic engineers.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The course content should  be taught and implemented with the aim to develop required  skills in the students so that they are able to acquire following competency:

## ï‚· Develop Verilog programs for VLSI based electronic systems

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The  theory  should  be  taught  and  practical  should  be  undertaken  in  such  a  manner  that students  are  able  to  acquire  required  learning  outcomes  in  cognitive,  psychomotor  and affective domains to demonstrate the following course outcomes:

- I. Describe working of MOSFET system
- II. Maintain MOS inverters
- III. Maintain MOS circuits
- IV. Describe fabrication process for MOS
- V. Develop VERILOG Programs for combinational and sequential circuits

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN  OUTCOMES

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are  embedded in many of the abovementioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st
- ii. year'Organization Level' in 2nd
3. iii year.'Characterization Level' in 3 rd
4. . year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY:

Only  the  major  Underpinning  Theory  is  formulated  as  higher  level  UOs  of Revised  Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  student-related co-curricular activities  which  can  be  undertaken  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the  various  outcomes  in  this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of each activity.

- i. Prepare chart to represent the CMOS design process
- ii. Prepare chart to represent the technological advancements in CMOS technology starting from transistors to current technology
- iii. Project- Build a small ASIC for your Home /Community.
- iv. Prepare chart showing the types of FPGA technology
- v. List out methods used in industries for each step used in CMOS design process.

## 11. SUGGESTED  SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL  STRATEGIES

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- i. Show Video/ Animation film explaining VLSI Design which are available on internet.
- ii. Arrange expert lecture on VHDL programming for real life applications.
- iii. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- iv. Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine
- v. Visit  industries  where  equipment/gadgets using  VLSI are being  manufactured/  assembled.
- vii.  Guide  student(s)  in undertaking  micro-projects.

## 12. SUGGESTED PROJECT LIST

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is groupbased. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project  could  be industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based. Each micro-project  should encompass two  or  more COs  which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.

## MICRO PROJECT 1: Prepare following Items.

1. Prepare graph showing relationship between feature size, number of transistors and year.

## MICRO PROJECT 2: Design Application oriented basic Project using FPGA.

1. Design and Implement LED flasher circuit.
2. Design and Implement circuit for relay-based operation using switch.
3. Design and  Implement Room Temperature  Monitor/Controller  System.
4. Design and  Implement  Water Level Indicator/controller  circuit

## MICRO PROJECT 3: Prepare following Items.

1. Prepare chart indicating the types of etching processes used with its application.
2. Prepare chart indicating the deposition processes with its application.
3. Prepare a  survey report  on the types of transistors used in memory elements.
4. Prepare a survey report on requirements of clean room and its classification
