of related skills leading to the achievement of the following competency
Utilize hardware and software technologies For the purpose of setting up, commissioning and
maintaining secure computer networks.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The theory should be taught and practical should be carried out in such a manner that students
are able to acquire different learning outcomes in cognitive, psychomotor and affective
domain to demonstrate following course outcomes.

- Analyze the key concepts of data communication, the various physical network topologies
and layered models.
ii. Select proper transmission media and devices based on network requirements
iii. Manage contemporary network infrastructures and configure fundamental network devices
based on criteria and analyze communication protocols of hardware layer
iv. Use Internet protocols and standards.

```
 above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
 competency.
-      Work as a leader/a team member.
-      Follow ethical practices.
 The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
 level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
 should gradually increase as planned below:
     ‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
 ii.     ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
 iii.    ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 7. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students
and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher
to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 9. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular
activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this
course: Students should conduct following activities in groups and prepare reports of each
activity.
- Prepare journals based on practical performance in the laboratory.
ii. Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx,
Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning
iii. Prepare chart to represent the Network Topology Diagrams, Protocol Stack Diagrams,
Flowcharts for Protocols, Error and Flow Control Graphs, Bandwidth Utilization Charts,
Network Performance Metrics, Comparison Charts for Data Link Protocols, Routing

Communication Medium Comparison, Ethical Hacking Incidents etc
iv. Explore real-world case studies of network implementations, failures, or security
breaches, encouraging students to analyze and propose solutions.
- To design a network in your department such as one drive can be accessible from any
other system.
vi. Prepare LAN cable and test it.( Practice cable stripping, untwisting, and proper crimping
techniques, Learn about different types of LAN cables, such as Cat5e, Cat6, or Cat6a, and
their applications, Create a simple diagram or documentation illustrating the cable
connections.)
vii. List different types of Network operating system.
viii. Identify the type of Network in your Institute.

- 0. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- Some of the topics/subtopics are relatively simple and very easy for the students for self-
learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.09, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities
and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for using the latest Technical Magazine.
- Arrange visit to relevant industry

Computer Networks & Data Communication                                         Course Code: 4361101

- Show video lectures to explore various network management tools, including both
graphical user interfaces (GUI) and command-line interfaces (CLI), emerging technologies,
such as 5G, IoT, or SDN, and their impact on network communication with help of the
internet.
- Invite industry experts to deliver guest lectures on current trends, challenges, and best
practices in computer networks and data communication

- 1. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so
that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to
be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a
seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should
not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought
to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
        A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.
- ICRO PROJECT: Prepare following Designs.
```

1. Dynamic Cloud Network Control Under Reconfiguration Delay and Cost.
2. Measuring Web Latency and Rendering Performance.
3. Configuration to a DHCP Server
4. Implement and Verify Static Routes
5. Connectivity Tests with Traceroute
6. Configure Dynamic NAT using Packet Tracer
7. configure Switch and Router VTY,Privilege and enable Password Assignment
8. Implement and Verify Default Routes
9. Client-Server based Instant Messenger.
- 0. Configure VLAN in Switch
- 1. Configure Web browser security settings.
- 2. Case study on Demonstration of wireless network between mobile device and PC for
file transfer.
- 3. Install a small wireless network using access points.
- 4. Develop a small Network. (Hands on Training.)

Students can do any other project suggested by faculties or any suggested student activity.
