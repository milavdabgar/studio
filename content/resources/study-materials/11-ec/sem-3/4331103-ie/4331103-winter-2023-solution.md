**Construction:**

- **Stator**: Contains windings (typically 3-phase)
- **Rotor**: Permanent magnets on rotor
- **Position sensing**: Hall effect sensors or encoders
- **Controller**: Electronic commutation controller

**Working principle:**

- **Electronic commutation**: Replaces mechanical brushes
- **Sequencing**: Controller energizes stator coils in sequence
- **Position feedback**: Hall sensors determine rotor position
- **Phase energizing**: Proper phase energized based on rotor position

**Advantages:**

- **High efficiency**: No brush friction losses
- **Low maintenance**: No brush wear
- **Longer lifespan**: Reliable operation
- **Better speed-torque characteristics**: Flat curve
- **Low noise**: Quiet operation
- **Better heat dissipation**: Windings on stator

**Applications:**

- **Computer cooling fans**: CPU/GPU coolers
- **Hard disk drives**: Spindle motors
- **Electric vehicles**: Propulsion systems
- **Drones**: Propeller motors
- **Home appliances**: Washing machines, refrigerators
- **Industrial automation**: Precision control systems

**Mnemonic:** "COPPER" - Commutation electronic, Operation efficient, Permanent magnets, Position sensors, Electronic control, Reliable performance
