## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Explain two transistor analogies of SCR.**

**Answer**:
SCR can be represented as a two-transistor model with interconnected PNP and NPN transistors. 

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Anode] --- B1[PNP Base]
    B1 --- C1[PNP Collector]
    C1 --- E2[NPN Emitter]
    E2 --- B2[NPN Base]
    B2 --- C2[NPN Collector]
    C2 --- K[Cathode]
    G[Gate] --- B2
    E1[PNP Emitter] --- A
    E1 --- B2
    C2 --- B1
```

- **Regenerative action**: When gate current triggers NPN, it causes PNP to conduct, creating self-sustaining current
- **Latching mechanism**: Once both transistors are ON, gate loses control as feedback path maintains conduction
