**Legends:** R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

i. Find Specifications and package of SCR, DIAC, TRIAC, UJT, PUT, POWER MOSFER, IGBT, and MCT from datasheet.<br>
ii. Find Specifications and package of Opto-TRIAC, Opto-SCR, Opto-Transistor, and Opto-coupler from datasheet.<br>
iii. Collect specification of commercially used UPS, Inverter, and SMPS in syllabus.<br>
iv. Find Specifications and package of IC-555, IC-556, and IC-XR2240 from datasheet.<br>
v. Find Specifications and package of DC shunt motor, Induction motor, Universal motor, and Servo motor, BLDC motor from datasheet.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.<br>
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.<br>
c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.<br>
d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.<br>
e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.<br>
f) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability<br>
g) Guide students for using data manuals.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that she/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

a) Fan regulator using TRIAC/DIAC<br>
b) Light operated Relay/Street Light Control.<br>
c) Water Level Controller.<br>
d) Home Appliances Automation.<br>
e) Automatic Door control and counting of persons.<br>
f) Cyclic Timer using IC555<br>
g) Star-Delta timer using IC555<br>
h) Solid State Relay using Diac-Triac<br>
i) SCR Firing using UJT.<br>
j) Arm ROBOT using Stepper Motor.<br>
k) Tone burst modulation using IC556<br>
l) Project on XR2240<br>
m) SMPS based on IC7840<br>
n) Projects on MOC3011<br>
o) Projects on MOC3031<br>
p) Zero cross detector using PC817<br>
q) Battery charger using SCR
