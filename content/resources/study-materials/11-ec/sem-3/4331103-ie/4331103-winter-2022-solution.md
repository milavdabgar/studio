| Stator | Contains multiple coil windings arranged in phases |
| Rotor | Permanent magnet or soft iron (reluctance type) |
| Bearings | Support shaft and allow rotation |
| Housing | Mechanical structure holding all components |
| Leads | Electrical connections to stator windings |

**Working Principle:**

- Digital pulses energize stator windings in sequence
- Magnetic field rotates in steps around stator
- Rotor follows magnetic field in precise angular steps
- Direction controlled by sequence of energization
- Speed controlled by pulse frequency

**Types of Stepper Motors:**

| Type | Characteristics |
|------|----------------|
| Variable Reluctance | No permanent magnet, high speed, low torque |
| Permanent Magnet | Simpler design, moderate torque, lower resolution |
| Hybrid | Combines both designs, high resolution, good torque |

**Applications:**

- CNC machines and 3D printers
- Robotics and automation
- Camera lens focusing mechanisms
- Precision positioning systems
- Medical equipment
- Office equipment (printers, scanners)
- Automotive applications (headlight positioning)
- Small consumer devices

**Mnemonic:** "REACT" - Rotation Exactly At Controlled Timing.
