    ZC --> MC[Microcontroller]
    MC --> OI[Opto-Isolator]
    OI --> T
    S[Speed Control] --> MC
```

**Working Principle:**

1. Zero-crossing detector identifies voltage zero-crossings
2. Microcontroller calculates delay based on speed setting
3. After delay, gate pulse sent through opto-isolator to TRIAC
4. TRIAC conducts for remainder of half-cycle
5. Varying firing angle controls voltage to motor, adjusting speed

- **TRIAC Rating**: Must handle starting current (5-7× running current)
- **Speed Range**: Limited at low end due to motor characteristics
- **Applications**: Fans, pumps, small machine tools

**Mnemonic:** "Zero Detected, Delay Determined, TRIAC Triggered"

    DIAC --> G[TRIAC Gate]
    R1 --> C1[C1]
    C1 --> P[Potentiometer]
    P --> F
```
