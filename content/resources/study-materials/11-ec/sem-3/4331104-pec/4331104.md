## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

a) Prepare specification of electronic components/ICs used in communication system.<br>
b) Give seminar on modulators, demodulators and communication techniques, types and applications.<br>
c) Undertake a survey of different communication methods used in field.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.<br>
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.<br>
c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.<br>
d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.<br>

g) Guide students for using data manuals.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

a) Build AM transmitter circuit using transistor/IC.<br>
b) Demonstrate AM communication System including AM transmitter and receiver.<br>
c) Build FM Transmitter circuit using IC.<br>
d) Demonstrate FM communication System including FM transmitter and receiver.<br>
e) Build a PAM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.<br>
f) Build a PWM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.<br>
g) Build a PPM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.<br>
h) Demonstrate Analog Communication system on Virtual Lab.<br>
i) Visit nearby FM radio station and prepare brief report including Gain, Frequency and Area specifications.<br>
j) Prepare Chart on Different Pulse Modulation techniques.<br>
k) Prepare Chart on Different line coding techniques.
