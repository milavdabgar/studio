## Question 2(b) [4 marks]

**Derive equation for total power transmitted for amplitude modulated signal considering carrier power and modulation index.**

**Answer**:

**Derivation of total power in AM:**

1. AM wave equation: vAM(t) = Vc[1 + μ sin(ωmt)] sin(ωct)

2. For power calculation, consider RMS values:
   - Carrier power (Pc) = Vc²/2R
   - Power in each sideband (PSB) = (μ²Vc²)/(4R)

3. Total power equation:
   - PT = Pc + PUSB + PLSB
   - PT = Pc + 2PSB (since upper and lower sidebands have equal power)
   - PT = Vc²/2R + 2(μ²Vc²)/(4R)
   - PT = (Vc²/2R)[1 + (μ²/2)]

4. Final equation: PT = Pc(1 + μ²/2)

**Mnemonic:** "Power Total = Power Carrier (1 + μ²/2)"

## Question 2(c) [7 marks]

**Explain basic principle of double sideband suppressed carrier amplitude modulation. Derive its voltage equation & draw only balanced modulator circuit using diode.**

**Answer**:

**Double Sideband Suppressed Carrier (DSBSC) Principle:**

- Carrier is suppressed, only sidebands transmitted
- Contains all information in sidebands
- More power efficient than AM
- Requires complex receiver for demodulation

**Voltage equation derivation:**

1. AM signal: vAM(t) = Vc[1 + μ sin(ωmt)]sin(ωct)
2. Removing carrier component: vDSBSC(t) = Vc × μ sin(ωmt)sin(ωct)
3. Using trigonometric identity: sin(A)sin(B) = 0.5[cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)]
4. Final equation: vDSBSC(t) = (Vcμ/2)[cos(ωc-ωm)t - cos(ωc+ωm)t]

   - Measures quality of reproduction
   - Affected by distortion and noise
   - Higher fidelity means better sound quality

**Mnemonic:** "Sensitive Selection Faithfully"

## Question 2(b) OR [4 marks]

**An AM signal has carrier power of 1 KW with 200 watt in each sideband. Find out modulation index.**

**Answer**:

**Given:**

- Carrier power (Pc) = 1 KW = 1000 W
- Power in each sideband (PSB) = 200 W

**To find:** Modulation index (μ)

**Solution:**

1. Total sideband power: PTSB = 2 × PSB = 2 × 200 = 400 W
2. Using formula: PTSB = Pc × μ²/2
3. 400 = 1000 × μ²/2
4. μ² = (400 × 2)/1000 = 800/1000 = 0.8
5. μ = √0.8 = 0.894 = 0.9 (approx)

**Mnemonic:** "Sideband Power Reveals Modulation μ"

        |----+----+----+----+----+-----> Frequency
                         fc+fm
```

**Advantages of SSB:**

- **Bandwidth efficiency**: Uses half bandwidth of AM

- **Less fading**: Improved performance in long-distance
- **Better SNR**: More power concentrated in information

**Power Comparison:**

1. In AM: PT = Pc(1 + μ²/2)
2. For μ = 1, PT = Pc(1 + 0.5) = 1.5Pc
3. AM power distribution: Carrier (Pc) = 67%, Sidebands = 33%
4. SSB uses only one sideband with no carrier
5. SSB power = 16.5% of total AM power = 1/6 approx.

**Mnemonic:** "Single Side Saves Bandwidth And Power"

## Question 3(a) OR [3 marks]

**State following. (1) Bandwidth of modulated signal if modulating frequency is 5 KHZ. (2) Image frequency if selected station frequency is 1000 KhZ in radio (3) Sampling frequency if baseband signal frequency is 10 KHz.**

**Answer**:

1. **Bandwidth of AM with modulating frequency 5 kHz:**
   - BW = 2 × fm = 2 × 5 kHz = 10 kHz

2. **Image frequency for 1000 kHz station with 455 kHz IF:**
   - For high-side injection: fimage = fstation + 2 × fIF
   - fimage = 1000 + 2 × 455 = 1000 + 910 = 1910 kHz

3. **Sampling frequency for 10 kHz baseband:**
   - fs > 2 × fmax (Nyquist rate)
   - fs > 2 × 10 kHz = 20 kHz
   - Sampling frequency should be > 20 kHz

**Mnemonic:** "Bandwidth Doubles, Image Adds Twice-IF, Sampling Needs Twice-Frequency"

## Question 4(a) [3 marks]

**Define Image frequency in a radio receiver and explain it with suitable example.**

**Answer**:

**Image Frequency**: Unwanted signal frequency that produces the same IF as the desired signal when mixed with local oscillator signal.

**Explanation:**

- For high-side injection: fimage = fsignal + 2 × fIF
- For low-side injection: fimage = fsignal - 2 × fIF

**Example:**

- Desired signal: 1000 kHz
- IF: 455 kHz
- Local oscillator frequency (high-side): fLO = 1000 + 455 = 1455 kHz
- Image frequency: fimage = fLO + 455 = 1455 + 455 = 1910 kHz
- Both 1000 kHz and 1910 kHz will produce 455 kHz IF when mixed with 1455 kHz

**Nyquist Criteria**: To reconstruct a bandlimited signal without distortion, sampling frequency must be at least twice the highest frequency component in the signal.

**Mathematical statement:**

- fs ≥ 2fmax
- fs = sampling frequency
- fmax = maximum frequency in signal

**Explanation:**

- Ensures no aliasing (frequency overlap) occurs
- Minimum sampling rate called Nyquist rate
- Sampling below Nyquist rate causes irreversible distortion
- In practice, fs > 2.2fmax used to allow for filtering

**Example:**

- For audio with fmax = 20 kHz
- Nyquist rate = 2 × 20 kHz = 40 kHz
- CD sampling rate = 44.1 kHz (>40 kHz)

**Mnemonic:** "Sample at least Twice as Fast as Highest Frequency"

## Question 4(b) OR [4 marks]

**Explain slope overload and granular noise for a delta modulation.**

**Answer**:

**Delta Modulation Issues:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Delta Modulation Problems] --> B[Slope Overload]
    A --> C[Granular Noise]
    B --> D[Step size too small]
    C --> E[Step size too large]
```

**Slope Overload:**

- Occurs when input signal changes faster than DM can track
- Step size too small for rapidly changing signals
- DM output cannot "catch up" with input
- Creates distortion at sharp transitions
- Solution: Increase step size or sampling rate

**Granular Noise:**

- Occurs during relatively constant signal portions
- Step size too large for slowly changing signals
- Output oscillates around input value
- Creates "roughness" in reconstructed signal
- Solution: Decrease step size

**Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM):** Dynamically adjusts step size to minimize both problems.

**Mnemonic:** "Slopes Need Bigger Steps, Flats Need Smaller Steps"

## Question 4(c) OR [7 marks]

**Draw and explain PCM transmitter and receiver in detail.**

**Answer**:

**PCM Transmitter:**

```mermaid

    A[Input Signal] --> B[Anti-aliasing Filter]
    B --> C[Sample & Hold]
    C --> D[Quantizer]
    D --> E[Encoder]
    E --> F[Digital Output]
```

**PCM Receiver:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Digital Input] --> B[Decoder]
    B --> C[D/A Converter]
    C --> D[Reconstruction Filter]
    D --> E[Output Signal]
```

**Transmitter Components:**

- **Anti-aliasing filter**: Limits input bandwidth to prevent aliasing
- **Sample & Hold**: Captures instantaneous values at regular intervals
- **Quantizer**: Approximates samples to predefined discrete levels
- **Encoder**: Converts quantized values to binary code

**Receiver Components:**

- **Decoder**: Converts binary code back to quantized values
- **D/A Converter**: Transforms discrete values to continuous voltage
- **Reconstruction filter**: Removes sampling frequency components, smooths output

**PCM Parameters:**

- **Resolution**: Determined by bits per sample (n)
- **Quantization levels**: L = 2^n
- **Bit rate**: R = n × fs (bits per second)
- **SNR**: Improves by ~6dB per bit added

**Mnemonic:** "Sample, Quantize, Encode; Decode, Convert, Reconstruct"

## Question 5(a) [3 marks]

**Define Bit, Bit rate and Baud rate with suitable example.**

**Answer**:

- **Bit**: Smallest unit of digital information, representing either 0 or 1.
  - Example: 10110 contains 5 bits

- **Bit Rate**: Number of bits transmitted per second.
  - Unit: bps (bits per second)
  - Example: 9600 bps means 9600 bits transmitted in one second

- **Baud Rate**: Number of signal changes (symbols) per second.
  - Unit: Baud
  - Example: In QPSK, each symbol represents 2 bits, so 9600 bps = 4800 Baud

**Relationship:**

- Bit Rate = Baud Rate × number of bits per symbol
- For binary signaling (1 bit/symbol): Bit Rate = Baud Rate
- For multilevel coding: Bit Rate > Baud Rate

**Mnemonic:** "Bits Build Data, Baud Brings Symbols"

## Question 5(b) [4 marks]

**Answer**:

**Multiplexing**: Technique that allows multiple signals to share a common transmission medium.

**Types of Multiplexing:**

- Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
- Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
- Code Division Multiplexing (CDM)
- Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM)

**Frequency Division Multiplexing:**

```goat
    Frequency
        ^
        |
        |  ┌───┐  ┌───┐  ┌───┐  ┌───┐
        |  │Ch1│  │Ch2│  │Ch3│  │Ch4│
        |  │   │  │   │  │   │  │   │
    0   |--+---+--+---+--+---+--+---+---> Frequency
        |  f1     f2     f3     f4
        |
        |  Guard Bands between channels
```

**FDM Working Principle:**

- Each signal modulated to different carrier frequency
- Bandwidth allocated to each channel with guard bands
- All channels transmitted simultaneously
- Receiver uses filters to separate channels
- Used in radio/TV broadcasting, cable systems

**Mnemonic:** "Frequency Divides Multiple Signals Simultaneously"

## Question 5(a) OR [3 marks]

**State types of TDM and explain any one of them.**

**Answer**:

**Types of TDM:**

- Synchronous TDM
- Asynchronous TDM (Statistical TDM)
- Intelligent TDM

**Synchronous TDM:**

- Fixed time slots allocated to each channel
- Time slots transmitted in fixed sequence
- Time slots remain empty if channel has no data
- Simpler implementation but less efficient
- Example: T1 carrier system (24 channels × 8 bits × 8000 samples/sec = 1.544 Mbps)

**Frame Structure:**

```goat
    ┌──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┬──────┐
    │ Sync │ Ch 1 │ Ch 2 │ Ch 3 │ Ch 4 │
    └──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┴──────┘
      Fixed slots regardless of activity
```

**Mnemonic:** "Synchronous Slots Stay Steady"

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Explain TDM. Also State its advantages and disadvantages.**

**Answer**:

**Time Division Multiplexing (TDM):** Technique where multiple signals share same transmission medium by allocating different time slots to each signal.

**Working Principle:**

- Each signal sampled at regular intervals
- Samples interleaved in time domain
- Complete frame contains one sample from each channel
- Receiver separates samples to reconstruct original signals

**Advantages of TDM:**

- **Single medium**: Efficiently uses one transmission path
- **Digital compatibility**: Naturally suits digital systems
- **Crosstalk elimination**: No interference between channels
- **Flexible capacity**: Easy to add/remove channels
- **Cost-effective**: Reduces hardware requirements

**Disadvantages of TDM:**

- **Synchronization critical**: Timing errors cause major problems
- **Complex equipment**: Requires precise timing circuits
- **Bandwidth limitation**: High bit rate needed for many channels
- **Inefficiency**: Wastes capacity when channels inactive (in synchronous TDM)
- **Buffer delays**: Can cause latency issues

**Mnemonic:** "Time Divided Multiple signals Save costs But Need Precise timing"

```

**Key characteristics:**

- **Unipolar RZ**: Returns to zero in middle of bit, only positive voltages
- **Polar NRZ**: No return to zero, uses positive and negative voltages
- **Manchester**: Mid-bit transition, rising edge = 0, falling edge = 1

**Mnemonic:** "Unipolar Rises then Zeros, Polar Never Returns, Manchester Always Transitions"
