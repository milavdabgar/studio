## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**What is modulation? What is the need of it?**

**Answer**:
Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties (amplitude, frequency, or phase) of a high-frequency carrier signal with a modulating signal containing information.

**Need for modulation:**

- **Antenna size reduction**: Makes practical antenna size possible (λ = c/f)
- **Multiplexing**: Allows multiple signals to share the medium
- **Noise reduction**: Improves SNR by shifting to higher frequency bands
- **Range extension**: Increases transmission distance

**Mnemonic:** "AMEN" - Antenna size, Multiplexing, Eliminate noise, New range

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Derive voltage equation for Amplitude modulation.**

**Answer**:
For AM, the carrier signal is modulated by the message signal.

**Mathematical derivation:**

- **Carrier signal**: $e_c(t) = A_c \cos(2\pi f_c t)$
- **Message signal**: $e_m(t) = A_m \cos(2\pi f_m t)$
- **Instantaneous amplitude**: $A_i = A_c + e_m(t)$
- **AM signal**: $e_{AM}(t) = A_i \cos(2\pi f_c t)$
- **Substituting**: $e_{AM}(t) = [A_c + A_m \cos(2\pi f_m t)] \cos(2\pi f_c t)$
- **Expanding**: $e_{AM}(t) = A_c\cos(2\pi f_c t) + A_m\cos(2\pi f_m t)\cos(2\pi f_c t)$
- **Final equation**: $e_{AM}(t) = A_c\cos(2\pi f_c t) + \frac{A_m}{2}\cos(2\pi(f_c+f_m)t) + \frac{A_m}{2}\cos(2\pi(f_c-f_m)t)$

## Question 2(c) [7 marks]

**Derive the equation for total power in AM, calculate percentage of power savings in DSB and SSB.**

**Answer**:

**Power in AM:**

The AM wave equation: $e_{AM}(t) = A_c[1 + m\cos(2\pi f_m t)]\cos(2\pi f_c t)$

**Power derivation:**

- **Total power**: $P_T = P_c\left(1 + \frac{m^2}{2}\right)$
- Where $P_c = \frac{A_c^2}{2R}$ (carrier power) and $m$ is modulation index

**Power distribution:**

- **Carrier power**: $P_c = \frac{A_c^2}{2R}$
- **Total sideband power**: $P_{SB} = \frac{m^2 P_c}{2}$
- **Each sideband**: $P_{LSB} = P_{USB} = \frac{m^2 P_c}{4}$

**Power savings:**

- **In DSB-SC**: No carrier power, so savings = $\frac{P_c}{P_T} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{1+\frac{m^2}{2}} \times 100\%$
  - For m=1, savings = 66.67%
- **In SSB**: No carrier and one sideband, so savings = $\frac{P_c + P_{SB}/2}{P_T} \times 100\%$
  - For m=1, savings = 83.33%

**Mnemonic:** "CEPTS" - Carrier Eliminated Provides Tremendous Savings

                Input Signal
```

**Characteristics:**

- Unequal step sizes throughout the amplitude range
- Smaller steps for low amplitudes, larger for high amplitudes
- Better matches human perception (logarithmic response)
- Improves SNR for small signals without increasing bit rate

**Implementation Methods:**

- **Companding**: Compressing at transmitter, expanding at receiver
- **Logarithmic coding**: μ-law (North America) and A-law (Europe)
- **Adaptive quantization**: Adjusts levels based on signal statistics

**Mnemonic:** "CLASP" - Compressed Levels, Adaptive Steps, Small steps for small signals, Perceptual matching

## Question 4(b) OR [4 marks]

**Explain Adaptive delta modulation with its application.**

**Answer**:

**Adaptive Delta Modulation (ADM):**

**Diagram:**

```mermaid

    A[Input Signal] --> B[Comparator]
    B --> C[1-bit Quantizer]
    C --> D[Transmission Channel]
    D --> E[Step Size Control]
    E --> F[Integrator]
    F --Feedback--> B
    F --> G[Output Signal]
    C --Controls--> E
```

**Operation:**

- Adapts step size based on input signal slope
- Increases step size for rapid changes (prevents slope overload)
- Decreases step size for slow changes (reduces granular noise)
- Uses previous bits pattern to determine slope changes

**Advantages:**

- Better signal tracking than DM
- Lower bit rate for same quality
- Reduced slope overload and granular noise
- Wider dynamic range

**Applications:**

- Speech and audio compression
- Voice-grade communication channels
- Digital telephony systems
- Video signal encoding
- Telemetry systems

**Mnemonic:** "ADAPT" - Automatically Decides Appropriate Pulse Transitions

## Question 4(c) OR [7 marks]

**What is sampling? Explain types of sampling in brief.**

**Answer**:

**Sampling Definition:**
Sampling is the process of converting a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal by taking measurements at regular intervals.

**Types of Sampling:**

| Type | Description | Diagram |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Ideal Sampling** | Instantaneous samples of infinitesimal duration | Impulses at sampling instants |
| **Natural Sampling** | Samples have finite width, amplitude follows input | Original signal visible during sampling duration |
| **Flat-top Sampling** | Samples have constant amplitude during sampling interval | Step-like appearance, used in sample-and-hold |

**Diagrams:**

   |                         |                         |
```

**Sampling Parameters:**

- **Sampling period (Ts)**: Time between consecutive samples
- **Sampling frequency (fs)**: Number of samples per second (fs = 1/Ts)
- **Nyquist rate**: Minimum sampling rate (fs > 2fm) to avoid aliasing

**Mnemonic:** "INFS" - Ideal (impulses), Natural (follows signal), Flat-top (constant), Sufficient rate

## Question 5(a) [3 marks]

**Define bit rate and baud rate.**

**Answer**:

**Bit Rate and Baud Rate:**

| Parameter | Definition | Formula | Unit |
|-----------|------------|---------|------|
| **Bit Rate** | Number of binary digits (bits) transmitted per second | R = fs × n | bits per second (bps) |
| **Baud Rate** | Number of signal elements or symbols transmitted per second | B = fs | symbols per second (baud) |

**Relationship:**

- For binary signaling: Bit Rate = Baud Rate
- For M-ary signaling: Bit Rate = Baud Rate × log₂M
  - Where M = number of different signal elements

**Example:**

- 4-QAM (M=4): Each symbol carries log₂4 = 2 bits
- If Baud Rate = 1000 symbols/s, then Bit Rate = 2000 bits/s

**Mnemonic:** "BBSM" - Bits per second, Baud for Symbols, Modulation determines relationship

## Question 5(b) [4 marks]

**Explain working of DPCM.**

**Answer**:

**Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM):**

**Block Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Transmitter"
    direction LR
    A[Input] --> B[Difference]
    B --> C[Quantizer]
    C --> D[Encoder]
    D --> E[Output]
    F[Predictor] --> B
    C --> F
    end

    subgraph "Receiver"
    direction LR    
    G[Input] --> H[Decoder]
    H --> I[Output]
    H --> J[Predictor]
    J --> I
    end
```

**Working Principle:**

- Encodes difference between current sample and predicted sample
- Prediction based on previous samples (correlation)
- Smaller dynamic range of differences allows fewer bits per sample

**Advantages:**

- Higher compression ratio than PCM
- Reduced bit rate for same quality
- Exploits signal correlation
- Improved SNR performance

**Mnemonic:** "DEEP" - Difference Encoded, Efficient Prediction, Exploits correlation, Preserves quality

**Mnemonic:** "UPAM" - Unipolar, Polar, AMI, Manchester encoding options

## Question 5(a) OR [3 marks]

**Compare RZ and NRZ coding with example.**

**Answer**:

**Comparison of RZ and NRZ Coding:**

| Parameter | Return-to-Zero (RZ) | Non-Return-to-Zero (NRZ) |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------------------|
| **Signal levels** | Returns to zero in each bit | Maintains level for full bit period |
| **Bandwidth** | Higher (≈ 2× NRZ) | Lower |
| **Self-clocking** | Better (transitions in every bit) | Poorer (may have long runs without transitions) |
| **Power requirement** | Higher | Lower |
| **Bit synchronization** | Easier | More difficult |
| **Implementation** | More complex | Simpler |
| **DC component** | Less | More |

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Explain delta modulation in brief.**

**Answer**:

**Delta Modulation (DM):**

**Block Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input Signal] --> B[(Comparator)]
    B --> C[1-bit Quantizer]
    C --> D[Transmission]
    C --> E[Integrator]
    E --Feedback--> B
    D --> F[Integrator]
    F --> G[Output Signal]
```

**Working Principle:**

- Encodes only the difference between samples using 1 bit
- Comparator checks if input is higher/lower than predicted value
- Integrator accumulates the bits to approximate original signal
- Output is series of 1s and 0s representing up/down steps

**Limitations:**

- **Slope Overload**: Cannot track rapidly changing signals
- **Granular Noise**: Small variations around steady signal

**Advantages:**

- Simplest form of differential encoding
- Low bit rate (1 bit per sample)
- Simple implementation
- Hardware efficiency

**Mnemonic:** "SIDE" - Single-bit, Integrates Differences, Encodes changes

    N4 --> O4[Channel n]
    end
```

**PCM-TDM Operation:**

|-------|---------|
| **Filtering** | Band-limits each channel to prevent aliasing |
| **Multiplexing** | Samples each channel sequentially |
| **Conversion** | Quantizes samples and converts to binary code |
| **Framing** | Adds sync bits and channel identification |
| **Transmission** | Sends frame over communication medium |
