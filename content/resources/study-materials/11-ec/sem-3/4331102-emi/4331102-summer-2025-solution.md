## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Define Accuracy, Precision, and Sensitivity.**

**Answer**:

- **Accuracy**: The closeness of a measured value to the actual or true value of a quantity.
- **Precision**: The ability of an instrument to reproduce the same output reading when the same input is applied repeatedly under the same conditions.
- **Sensitivity**: The ratio of change in output of an instrument to the change in input, indicating how much output changes for a small change in input.

**Table: Differences between Accuracy and Precision**

| Parameter | Accuracy | Precision |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Definition | Closeness to true value | Repeatability of measurement |
| Focus on | Correctness | Consistency |
| Representation | Bulls-eye center hits | Clustered hits |

**Mnemonic:** "APS - Accuracy Pinpoints truth, Precision Shows repeatability, Sensitivity Signals small changes"

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Describe the working and limitations of the Wheatstone bridge with circuit diagram.**

**Answer**:

**Working**: The Wheatstone bridge measures unknown resistance by balancing two legs of a bridge circuit.

**Circuit Diagram**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Battery] --> B[Point A]
    A --> C[Point C]
    B --> D[Point B]
    B --> E[Point D]
    C --> E
    C --> F[Point C]
    D --- G[Galvanometer]
    F --- G
    B -- R1 --- D
    D -- R2 --- C
    B -- R3 --- F
    F -- Rx --- C
```

When bridge is balanced: R1/R2 = R3/Rx, so Rx = R3×(R2/R1)

**Limitations**:

- **Limited range**: Not suitable for very low or very high resistances
- **Temperature effects**: Resistance changes with temperature
- **Battery errors**: Output voltage must remain stable
- **Galvanometer sensitivity**: Limited by detector sensitivity

**Mnemonic:** "BALR - Balance is key, Adjust until null, Low/high resistances problematic, Range is limited"

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

**Explain various transducers used for temperature measurement. Explain the construction and working of the following in detail: (i) Thermocouple (ii) Thermistor.**

| Thermistor | Resistance change | -50°C to 300°C | High sensitivity | Nonlinear, limited range |
| RTD | Resistance change | -200°C to 850°C | High accuracy, linear | Expensive, self-heating |
| IC Sensors | Semiconductor | -55°C to 150°C | Linear output, easy interface | Limited range |

**(i) Thermocouple**:

    A[Metal A] --- B[Measuring Junction]
    C[Metal B] --- B
    A --- D[Reference Junction]
    C --- D
    D --- E[Measuring Instrument]
```

- **Cold junction compensation**: Required for accuracy
- **Types**: J, K, T, E based on metal combinations

**(ii) Thermistor**:

**Construction**: A semiconductor material (metal oxides like manganese, nickel, cobalt) shaped into a bead, disk, or rod with two lead wires.

    +-----------------+
    |   Ceramic or    |
    | Semiconductor   |
    |     Body        |
    +-----------------+
```

**Working**: Resistance decreases as temperature increases (NTC type) or increases with temperature (PTC type).

**Key Points**:

2. Measure time difference (Δt) between corresponding points
3. Measure time period (T) of complete cycle
4. Calculate phase difference: φ = (Δt/T) × 360°
