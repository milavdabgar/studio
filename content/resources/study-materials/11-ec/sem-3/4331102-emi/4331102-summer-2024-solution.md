## Question 2(c) [7 marks]

**1- A moving coil ammeter reading up to 10 amperes has a resistance of 0.02 ohm. How this instrument could be adopted to read current up to 1000 amperes?**
**2- A moving coil voltmeter reading up to 200 mV has a resistance of 5 ohms. How this instrument can be adopted to read voltage up to 300 volts?**

**Answer**:

**Part 1: Ammeter Range Extension**

To extend ammeter range from 10A to 1000A, a shunt resistor is connected in parallel with the meter.

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Current Input] --> B{Branch}
    B -->|Shunt Path| C[Rsh]

    C --> E{Join}
    D --> E
    E --> F[Output]
    style C fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Calculation:**

- Original meter resistance (Rm) = 0.02 Ω
- Original full-scale current (Im) = 10 A
- Desired full-scale current (I) = 1000 A
- Current through shunt (Ish) = I - Im = 1000 - 10 = 990 A
- Voltage across meter = Voltage across shunt
- Im × Rm = Ish × Rsh
- Rsh = (Im × Rm) ÷ Ish = (10 × 0.02) ÷ 990 = 0.0002 Ω

**Part 2: Voltmeter Range Extension**

To extend voltmeter range from 200mV to 300V, a multiplier resistor is connected in series with the meter.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Voltage Input] --> B[Rs]
    B --> C[Meter]
    C --> D[Output]
    style B fill:#f96,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Calculation:**

- Original meter resistance (Rm) = 5 Ω
- Original full-scale voltage (Vm) = 200 mV = 0.2 V
- Desired full-scale voltage (V) = 300 V
- Series resistance (Rs) = [(V ÷ Vm) - 1] × Rm
- Rs = [(300 ÷ 0.2) - 1] × 5 = (1500 - 1) × 5 = 1499 × 5 = 7495 Ω

## Question 3(a) [3 marks]

**In CRO What is the value of unknown DC voltage, if a straight line below x-axis is obtained with a displacement of 4cm and volt/div knob = 3V. calculate the unknown voltage Vdc.**

**Answer**:

**Calculation:**
Displacement = 4 cm (below x-axis)
Volt/div setting = 3 V/div
Direction = Below x-axis (negative voltage)

Vdc = -(Displacement × Volt/div)
Vdc = -(4 cm × 3 V/div)
Vdc = -12 V

Therefore, the unknown DC voltage is -12 V.

## Question 3(a) OR [3 marks]

**In CRO vertical displacement for peak is = 1cm and volt/div knob = 10mV. Find peak value and RMS value of voltage.**

**Answer**:

**Calculation:**
Vertical displacement (peak) = 1 cm
Volt/div setting = 10 mV/div

Peak value (Vp) = Displacement × Volt/div
Vp = 1 cm × 10 mV/div = 10 mV

For sinusoidal waveform:
RMS value (Vrms) = Vp ÷ √2
Vrms = 10 mV ÷ 1.414 = 7.07 mV

Therefore, peak value = 10 mV and RMS value = 7.07 mV.
