## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

a) Build a small circuit for 30 V DC measurement using PMMC meter<br>
b) Build a simple circuit to measure DC voltage using ICL 7107 or MAX07<br>
c) Build a small circuit for 300 V ac measurement using PMMC meter<br>
d) Build a simple counter circuit for measuring line frequency (50 Hz)<br>
e) Build a simple circuit for measurement of displacement using optical encoder<br>
f) Build a simple circuit for measurement of room temperature using LM35<br>
g) Build a simple circuit of function generator using IC 8038 or XR2206<br>
h) Disposal of old instruments - Prepare a chart or report on handling, recycling and disposal of old instruments with figures, tables and comparative charts and strategies used or suggested.
