**Legends:** R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

a) Prepare specification of electronics instruments.<br>
b) Give seminars on DSO, MSO, Various transducers and sensors.<br>
c) Undertake a market survey of different electronics instruments.<br>
d) Prepare plan for disposal of E-waste of old and non-use electronics instruments as per GPCB and CPCB guidelines.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.<br>
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.<br>
c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.<br>
d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.<br>
e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.<br>
f) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability<br>
g) Guide students for using specification and data manuals of different instruments.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

a) Build a small circuit for 30 V DC measurement using PMMC meter<br>
b) Build a simple circuit to measure DC voltage using ICL 7107 or MAX07<br>
c) Build a small circuit for 300 V ac measurement using PMMC meter<br>
d) Build a simple counter circuit for measuring line frequency (50 Hz)<br>
e) Build a simple circuit for measurement of displacement using optical encoder<br>
f) Build a simple circuit for measurement of room temperature using LM35<br>
g) Build a simple circuit of function generator using IC 8038 or XR2206<br>
h) Disposal of old instruments - Prepare a chart or report on handling, recycling and disposal of old instruments with figures, tables and comparative charts and strategies used or suggested.
