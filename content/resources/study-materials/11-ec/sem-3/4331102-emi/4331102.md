## 1. Rationale

Troubleshooting of electronic equipment is an essential skill required in service sector industry,
which is growing very fast in our country. This course will help students to develop skills to
become professional technicians with capability to measure various electrical, electronic and
instrumentation parameters using instruments. By learning this course, students will be able to
know the basics and use of various Instruments, transducers, sensors and working of electronic
circuits used in electronic test and measuring instruments.

## 2. Competency

The course content should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop different types of
skills leading to the achievement of following competency

Use various electronic test and measuring instruments for measurement process.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

- Measure values of various passive components with proper accuracy,          precision
and resolution
- Measure various electrical parameters using different electrical and electronic meters.
- Measure various signal parameters using advanced electronic instruments.
- Select appropriate transducer and sensor for measurement of physical quantity.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the above
mentioned COs and PrO s. More could be added to fulfill the development of this competency.
- Work as a leader /a team member.
- Follow safety practices while using electrical appliances.
- Practice environment friendly methods and processes. (Environment related issues
like disposal of E-waste items like instruments and trainer kits)

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level
of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should
gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1 year       st

ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2 year.         nd

iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3 year.         rd

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students
and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher
to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare
reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their
(student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare specification of electronics instruments.
- Give seminars on DSO, MSO, Various transducers and sensors.
- Undertake a market survey of different electronics instruments.
- Prepare plan for disposal of E-waste of old and non-use electronics instruments as per
- PCB and CPCB guidelines.

- 1.SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:

- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.

- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.

- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by
teachers to develop the outcomes.

- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be
given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.

- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions
for co-curricular activities.

- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability

- Guide students for using specification and data manuals of different instruments.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so
that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to
be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, workshop-based, laboratory-
based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact,
## Practical Outcomes

```
an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary
consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it
Electronic Measurements and Instruments                                        Course Code: 4331102

before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen)
student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by
the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs.
Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Build a small circuit for 30 V DC measurement using PMMC meter
- Build a simple circuit to measure DC voltage using ICL 7107 or MAX07
- Build a small circuit for 300 V ac measurement using PMMC meter
- Build a simple counter circuit for measuring line frequency (50 Hz)
- Build a simple circuit for measurement of displacement using optical encoder
- Build a simple circuit for measurement of room temperature using LM35
- Build a simple circuit of function generator using IC 8038 or XR2206
-     Disposal of old instruments
- Prepare a chart or report on handling, recycling and disposal of old instruments
         with figures, tables and comparative charts and strategies used or suggested.
