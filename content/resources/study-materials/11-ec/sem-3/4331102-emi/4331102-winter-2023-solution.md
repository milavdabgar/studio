| Block | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Input Conditioning** | Amplifies, shapes input signal into pulses |
| **Gate Control** | Controls counting period based on time base |
| **Time Base** | Provides accurate reference time interval |
| **Counter** | Counts input pulses during gate period |
| **Display** | Shows count result (frequency) |

- **Working Principle**: Counts pulses over precise time interval (typically 1 second)
- **Frequency Calculation**: f = counts/time interval
- **Resolution**: Determined by time base accuracy and gate time

## Question 5(b OR) [4 marks]

**Draw and Explain Capacitive Transducer.**

**Answer**:

**Diagram:**

```goat
    +-------------+
    |    Fixed    |
    |   Plate 1   |
    +-------------+
           ↑
           d      ↓ Force
    +-------------+
    |   Movable   |
    |   Plate 2   |-----> Output
    +-------------+
```

| Configuration | Principle | Application |
|---------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Variable Gap** | C = ε₀εᵣA/d (varies inversely with distance) | Pressure, displacement |
| **Variable Area** | C = ε₀εᵣA/d (varies directly with overlap area) | Angular position, level |
| **Variable Dielectric** | C = ε₀εᵣA/d (varies with dielectric constant) | Humidity, material analysis |

**Working Principle:**

- Capacitance changes with physical parameter
- Signal conditioning converts capacitance to voltage/current
- High impedance output requires proper shielding

**Advantages**: High sensitivity, no moving contacts, low mass

**Mnemonic:** "CGAD - Capacitance Gap Area Dielectric"

```

| Block | Function |
|-------|----------|
| **Frequency Control** | Sets oscillator frequency (typically 0.1Hz to 20MHz) |
| **Waveform Generator** | Produces basic waveforms (sine, square, triangle) |
| **Mode Selector** | Selects output waveform type |
| **Amplifier & Attenuator** | Controls output amplitude |
| **Output Buffer** | Provides low output impedance |
