## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Define (i) Node (ii) Branch and (iii) Loop for electronic network.**

**Answer**:

**Node**:

- **Junction point** where two or more branches meet in a network
- Points where elements are connected together
- Current sum of all branches at a node equals zero

**Branch**:

- **Single element** (R, L, or C) or path connecting two nodes
- Each branch has a specific current flowing through it
- Active branches contain sources; passive branches contain R, L, C

**Loop**:

- **Closed path** in a network formed by connected branches
- No node is encountered more than once
- Used in loop analysis for solving networks

- **Frequency range** between half-power points
- At half-power points, impedance is √2 times minimum value
- BW = f₂ - f₁, where f₁ and f₂ are lower and upper cutoff frequencies

**Selectivity:**

- **Ability to reject** frequencies outside the bandwidth
- Higher Q means higher selectivity and narrower bandwidth
- Measured by steepness of response curve

**Table: Series RLC Bandwidth Parameters**

| Parameter | Formula | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Bandwidth (BW) | BW = f₂ - f₁ | Difference between upper and lower cutoff points |
| Half-power points | Z = √2 × Zₘᵢₙ | Points where power drops to half of maximum |
| Resonant frequency | fr = 1/(2π√LC) | Center frequency |
| Quality factor | Q = ωₒL/R | Energy storage vs. dissipation ratio |

**Derivation of Q-BW Relationship:**

- At resonance, impedance Z = R
- At cutoff frequencies, Z = √2R
- This occurs when reactance XL - XC = ±R
- At f₁: ωL - 1/ωC = -R
- At f₂: ωL - 1/ωC = +R
- Solving these equations: BW = R/2πL = fr/Q
- Therefore, Q = fr/BW

**Mnemonic:** "Quality inversely proportional to bandwidth"
