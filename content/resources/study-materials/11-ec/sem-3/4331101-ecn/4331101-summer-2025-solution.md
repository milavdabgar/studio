| **Active elements** | Electronic components that can supply energy or power to a circuit (like batteries, generators, op-amps) |
| **Bilateral elements** | Components that allow current flow equally in both directions with same characteristics (like resistors, capacitors, inductors) |
| **Linear elements** | Components whose current-voltage relationship follows a straight line and obeys the principle of superposition (like resistors following Ohm's law) |

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Capacitors of 10µF, 20µF and 30µF are connected in series and supply of 200V DC is given. Find voltage across each capacitor.**

**Answer**:

For series-connected capacitors:

1. Find equivalent capacitance: 1/Ceq = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃
2. Voltage division: VC = (C₁/C) × V

**Calculation:**
1/Ceq = 1/10 + 1/20 + 1/30 = 0.1 + 0.05 + 0.033 = 0.183
Ceq = 5.46 μF

| Capacitor | Formula | Calculation | Voltage |
|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| C₁ = 10μF | V₁ = (Ceq/C₁) × V | (5.46/10) × 200 = 109.2V | 109.2V |
| C₂ = 20μF | V₂ = (Ceq/C₂) × V | (5.46/20) × 200 = 54.6V | 54.6V |
| C₃ = 30μF | V₃ = (Ceq/C₃) × V | (5.46/30) × 200 = 36.4V | 36.4V |

```

**Mathematical explanation:**

- For resistors: V₁ = (R₁/RT) × VS
- For capacitors: V₁ = (1/C₁)/(1/CT) × VS = (CT/C₁) × VS
- For inductors: V₁ = (L₁/LT) × VS
- For complex impedances: V₁ = (Z₁/ZT) × VS

**Examples:**

1. Voltage across a 1kΩ resistor in series with 4kΩ with 5V source = (1/5)×5V = 1V
2. Voltage across a 10μF capacitor in series with 40μF with 10V source = (1/10)/(1/8)×10V = 8V

- Maximum power: Pmax = V²/(4×Rsource)

**Key points:**

- **Efficiency**: Only 50% at maximum power transfer
- **AC Circuits**: Load impedance must be complex conjugate of source impedance
- **Applications**: Signal transmission, audio systems, RF circuits

**Answer**:

**Thevenin's Theorem Application:**

**Principle:**
Any linear electrical network with voltage and current sources can be replaced by an equivalent circuit with a single voltage source Vth and a series resistance Rth.

**Steps:**

1. Remove the load resistance from the circuit
2. Calculate open-circuit voltage (Vth) across the load terminals
3. Replace all sources with their internal resistances (voltage sources as short circuits, current sources as open circuits)
4. Calculate equivalent resistance (Rth) seen from the load terminals
5. Draw the Thevenin equivalent circuit with Vth and Rth
6. Reconnect the load and calculate load current: IL = Vth/(Rth + RL)

```

**Example calculation:**

## Question 4(b) [4 marks]

**Derive an equation for Quality factor of coil.**

**Answer**:

**Quality Factor (Q) of a Coil:**

**Definition:**
Q-factor is the ratio of energy stored to energy dissipated per cycle in a resonant circuit.

**Derivation:**
For a coil with inductance L and resistance R:

1. Energy stored in inductor: WL = ½LI²
2. Power dissipated in resistance: P = I²R
3. Time period: T = 1/f = 2π/ω
4. Energy dissipated per cycle: Wd = P×T = I²R×(2π/ω)
5. Q = 2π(Energy stored/Energy dissipated per cycle)
6. Q = 2π(½LI²)/(I²R×2π/ω) = ωL/R

**Final Equation:**
Q = ωL/R = 2πfL/R

**Significance:**

- Higher Q indicates lower energy loss
- Q increases with frequency
- Q decreases with resistance

**Mnemonic:** "Omega-L over R gives Quality"

## Question 4(a) OR [3 marks]

**Define Mutual Inductance.**

**Answer**:

**Mutual Inductance:**

Mutual inductance is the property of a circuit whereby a change in current in one coil induces a voltage in another coil due to the magnetic coupling between them.

**Mathematical expression:**

- Voltage induced in coil 2: V₂ = -M(dI₁/dt)
- M = k√(L₁L₂) where k is the coupling coefficient (0≤k≤1)
- Unit: Henry (H)

**Key properties:**

- Depends on coil geometry, distance and orientation
- Proportional to both inductances
- Basis for transformers and coupled circuits
- Can be positive or negative based on mutual flux direction

**Mnemonic:** "MICK: Mutual Inductance links Coils through K-coupling"

## Question 4(b) OR [4 marks]

**Derive equation of coefficient of coupling**

**Answer**:

**Coefficient of Coupling (k):**

**Definition:**
The coefficient of coupling (k) is a measure of the magnetic coupling between two coils, ranging from 0 (no coupling) to 1 (perfect coupling).

**Derivation:**

1. Define mutual inductance: M = magnetic flux linkage / current
2. For two coils with self-inductances L₁ and L₂:
   - Flux linkage in coil 1 due to current in coil 1: λ₁₁ = L₁I₁
   - Flux linkage in coil 2 due to current in coil 2: λ₂₂ = L₂I₂
   - Flux linkage in coil 2 due to current in coil 1: λ₂₁ = MI₁
3. The coupling coefficient k represents the fraction of flux from coil 1 that links with coil 2
4. From electromagnetic theory: M = k√(L₁L₂)
5. Rearranging: k = M/√(L₁L₂)

**Final Equation:**
k = M/√(L₁L₂)

**Key points:**

- k = 0: No magnetic coupling
- 0 < k < 1: Partial coupling
- k = 1: Perfect coupling (all flux links both coils)

**Mnemonic:** "M divided by Geometric Mean of Ls"

              +---+
               R
```

**Derivation steps:**

1. For a parallel RLC circuit, the admittance is:
   Y = 1/Z = 1/R + 1/jωL + jωC

2. At resonance, the imaginary part becomes zero:
   Im(Y) = 0
   1/jωL + jωC = 0
   -j/ωL + jωC = 0
   1/ωL = ωC
   ω²LC = 1

3. For the ideal case (with infinite resistance):
   ω₀ = 1/√(LC)
   f₀ = 1/(2π√(LC))

4. For the real case (with resistance R):
   If R is in series with L, the resonant frequency becomes:
   f₀ = (1/2π)√(1/LC - R²/L²)

**Final Equation:**

- Ideal case: f₀ = 1/(2π√(LC))
- Real case (R in series with L): f₀ = (1/2π)√(1/LC - R²/L²)

**Key characteristics of parallel resonance:**

- Maximum impedance at resonance
- Minimum current drawn from source
- Current circulates between L and C
- Also called "anti-resonance" or "rejector circuit"

**Derive relation between Decibel and Neper**

**Answer**:

**Decibel to Neper Conversion:**

**Definitions:**

- **Decibel (dB)**: Power ratio logarithm using base 10 (common logarithm)
- **Neper (Np)**: Voltage/current ratio logarithm using base e (natural logarithm)

**Derivation:**

1. Power ratio in dB: Loss(dB) = 10 log₁₀(P₁/P₂)
2. Voltage ratio in dB: Loss(dB) = 20 log₁₀(V₁/V₂)
3. Voltage ratio in Nepers: Loss(Np) = ln(V₁/V₂)
4. Converting between logarithm bases: log₁₀(x) = ln(x)/ln(10)
5. Substitute: Loss(dB) = 20 ln(V₁/V₂)/ln(10) = 20 Loss(Np)/ln(10)

**Final Relation:**

- 1 Neper = ln(10)/20 × 10 dB = 8.686 dB
- 1 dB = 0.115 Neper

**Table:**

| Conversion | Formula | Value |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Neper to dB | 1 Np = (20/ln10) dB | 1 Np = 8.686 dB |
| dB to Neper | 1 dB = (ln10/20) Np | 1 dB = 0.115 Np |

**Design Theory:**
A constant-K filter has impedance product Z₁Z₂ = k² (constant) at all frequencies.

**Derivation Steps:**

1. For a T-section low-pass filter:
   - Series impedance Z₁ = jωL
   - Shunt impedance Z₂ = 1/jωC

2. Product Z₁Z₂ must be constant:
   - Z₁Z₂ = jωL × 1/jωC = L/C = k²

3. Characteristic impedance at zero frequency:
   - R₀ = √(L/C)

4. Cut-off frequency occurs when:
   - Z₁ = 2Z₀ at ω = ωc
   - jωcL = 2R₀ = 2√(L/C)
   - ωc² = 4/LC
   - ωc = 2/√(LC)
   - fc = 1/π√(LC)

5. Design equations:
   - L = R₀/πfc
   - C = 1/(πfcR₀)

**Final Equations:**

- Cut-off frequency: fc = 1/π√(LC)
- Inductance: L = R₀/πfc
- Capacitance: C = 1/(πfcR₀)

**T-section values:**

- Series inductance: L/2 each arm
- Shunt capacitance: C
