## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Explain Source transformation with appropriate diagram.**

**Answer**:
Source transformation is a technique to convert voltage source to current source or vice-versa without changing the external circuit behavior.

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Voltage Source Circuit"
    VS[V] --- RS[R]
    end
    subgraph "Current Source Circuit"
    IS[I] -.- RP[R]
    end

    VS --- IS
    
    class VS,IS fill:#f96
```

- **Voltage to Current Source**: I = V/R, same R in parallel
- **Current to Voltage Source**: V = I×R, same R in series

**Mnemonic:** "Value Stays, Resistance Shifts" (V=IR always applies)

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Determine voltage, current and power relationship for two capacitor connected in series.**

**Answer**:

**Table: Capacitors in Series**

| Parameter | Formula | Explanation |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| Total Capacitance | 1/C<sub>T</sub> = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ | Reciprocal sum |
| Voltage Distribution | V₁/V₂ = C₂/C₁ | Inverse to capacitance ratio |
| Current | I = I₁ = I₂ | Same current flows through all |
| Charge | Q = Q₁ = Q₂ | Same charge on each capacitor |
| Power | P = VI = V²/X<sub>c</sub> | Where X<sub>c</sub> = 1/2πfC |

- **Voltage division**: V₁ = V × C₂/(C₁+C₂)
- **Charge storage**: Q = C₁C₂V/(C₁+C₂)

**Mnemonic:** "Capacitors in Series: Currents Same, Capacitance Shrinks"

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

**State difference between Series and parallel connection of resistor and derive the equation of total resistance of parallel connection.**

**Answer**:

**Table: Series vs Parallel Resistors**

| Parameter | Series Connection | Parallel Connection |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Total Resistance | Increases (R<sub>T</sub> = R₁ + R₂ + ...) | Decreases (R<sub>T</sub> < smallest R) |
| Current | Same through all (I) | Divides (I<sub>T</sub> = I₁ + I₂ + ...) |
| Voltage | Divides (V<sub>T</sub> = V₁ + V₂ + ...) | Same across all (V) |
| Power | P<sub>T</sub> = P₁ + P₂ + ... | P<sub>T</sub> = P₁ + P₂ + ... |

**Derivation for Parallel Resistance:**

By Kirchhoff's Current Law:
I<sub>T</sub> = I₁ + I₂ + ... + I<sub>n</sub>

Substituting I = V/R:
V/R<sub>T</sub> = V/R₁ + V/R₂ + ... + V/R<sub>n</sub>

Dividing by V:
1/R<sub>T</sub> = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ... + 1/R<sub>n</sub>

For two resistors:
1/R<sub>T</sub> = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂, which gives R<sub>T</sub> = R₁R₂/(R₁+R₂)

**Mnemonic:** "In Parallel, Reciprocals Add"

     |           |          |
     o----Z₀π----o----Z₀π---o
```

**Derivation:**

1. For symmetrical π-network, admittance Y₁ in shunt arms is split into 2 equal parts (Y₃ = Y₁/2)
2. For image impedance matching: Z₀π = Z₀π′

By current division:
I₂/I₁ = Z₀π/(Z₀π + Z₁ + Z₀π||2Z₃)

For matched condition:
Z₀π² = Z₁(2Z₃)/(Z₁ + 2Z₃)

Simplifying:
Z₀π = √[Z₁(2Z₃)/(Z₁ + 2Z₃)]
Z₀π = √[2Z₁Z₃/(Z₁ + 2Z₃)]

- Where L = 10 mH, C = 0.1 μF

Calculation:
f<sub>c</sub> = 1/(π√(10×10⁻³ × 0.1×10⁻⁶)) = 1/(π√(10⁻⁹)) = 1/(π×10⁻⁴·⁵) = 3.18 kHz
R₀ = √(10×10⁻³/0.1×10⁻⁶) = √(10⁵) = 316.23 Ω

**For π-section:**

- Cut-off frequency: f<sub>c</sub> = 1/(π√(LC))
- Nominal impedance: R₀ = √(L/C)
- Same values as T-section

**Mnemonic:** "Cut-off frequency is inverse to the square root of LC"

## Question 5(a) OR [3 marks]

**Explain the limitation of constant k type filters.**

**Answer**:

**Table: Limitations of Constant-k Filters**

| Limitation | Description | Effect |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| Impedance Matching | Impedance varies with frequency | Signal reflection, power loss |
| Attenuation Band | Gradual transition at cut-off | Poor frequency selectivity |
| Phase Response | Non-linear phase characteristic | Signal distortion |
| Passband Ripple | Non-uniform response in passband | Signal amplitude variation |
| Roll-off Rate | Slow roll-off (20 dB/decade) | Poor stop-band rejection |

- **Main issue**: Poor transition from pass to stop band
- **Improvement**: Using m-derived filters

**Mnemonic:** "Poor Matching And Transition Results In Distortion"

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Derive equation of cut-off frequency for T-type Constant-k high Pass filter.**

**Answer**:

**Diagram: T-type Constant-k High Pass Filter**

              |
    o---------o-------------o
```

**Derivation:**

1. For high-pass filter, series elements are capacitors and shunt elements are inductors
2. Transfer function: H(jω) = Z₂/(Z₁ + Z₂)
3. Where Z₁ = 1/(jωC) and Z₂ = jωL
4. Impedance condition for cut-off: Z₁/Z₂ = 4 or Z₁/4Z₂ = 1
5. Substituting: 1/(jωC) = 4jωL
6. Solving for ω: ω² = 1/(4LC)
7. Cut-off frequency: f<sub>c</sub> = 1/(4π√(LC))

**Mnemonic:** "High Pass cuts frequencies below one over four pi L-C"

## Question 5(c) OR [7 marks]

**Give classification of filters using definitions and characteristics graphs for each.**

**Answer**:

**Table: Filter Classification**

| Filter Type | Passes | Blocks | Applications |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Low-Pass | Frequencies below f<sub>c</sub> | Frequencies above f<sub>c</sub> | Audio amplifiers, power supplies |
| High-Pass | Frequencies above f<sub>c</sub> | Frequencies below f<sub>c</sub> | Noise elimination, treble control |
| Band-Pass | Range between f<sub>L</sub> and f<sub>H</sub> | Frequencies outside range | Radio tuning, equalizers |
| Band-Stop | Frequencies outside range | Range between f<sub>L</sub> and f<sub>H</sub> | Noise elimination, notch filters |
| All-Pass | All frequencies with unity gain | None (changes only phase) | Phase correction, time delay |
