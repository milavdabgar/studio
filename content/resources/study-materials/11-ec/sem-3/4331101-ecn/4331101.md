## 1. Rationale

Electrical, Electronic, Instrumentation and allied engineering diploma holders are
expected to Design and analyze various Electronic networks. “Electronic Circuits &
Networks” is a core area, the knowledge of which is essential for electronic
engineering diploma holders and they need to assimilate it in order to succeed in the
Industry. In this regard, the basic knowledge of various theorems, resonance, filtering
and attenuation related to passive electronic components is essential. Understanding
of these concepts will be useful to determine the various parameters required to solve
various problems and applications. This course has been designed to achieve these
aims.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Analyze Electronic Circuits & Networks in terms of Voltage, Current
Power, Attenuation and Frequency Response.
## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of
the following COs:
- Analyze the DC circuit to calculate voltage and current at various points in the
circuit.
- Understand Concepts Of Two Port Network With Parameters.
- Use various network theorems to analyze electronic networks.
- Calculate parameters of series/parallel resonant and coupled circuits.
- Build different types of Attenuators and constant K-type passive filters.

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow safety practices while using electrical, electronics, pneumatic instruments
      and tools.
The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
  ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
  iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised
Bloom’s taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If
required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment
of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of
the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group
and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record
physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement
interviews:

- Teacher guided tutorial exercises to solve problems based on all units.
- Implement all circuits on breadboard and verify the design.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature can be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be
assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the
micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth
semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

```
which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and
give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project
should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course.
The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the
industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Different types of electronic component: Prepare a board consist of different
     Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor, chokes, transformer, fuse, diode, and transistor.
