**Answer**:

**Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL)**: The algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.

**Mathematically**: ∑V = 0 (around a closed loop)

**Circuit Example**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A((\+)) --"10V"--> B
    B --"R₁ = 2Ω"--> C
    C --"R₂ = 3Ω"--> D
    D --"R₃ = 5Ω"--> A

    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

If I = 1A, then:

- V₁ = 1A × 2Ω = 2V
- V₂ = 1A × 3Ω = 3V
- V₃ = 1A × 5Ω = 5V

Applying KVL: 10V - 2V - 3V - 5V = 0 ✓

## Question 3(a) [3 marks]

**Explain Kirchhoff's current law with example.**

**Answer**:

**Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL)**: The algebraic sum of all currents entering and leaving a node must equal zero.

**Mathematically**: ∑I = 0 (at any node)

**Circuit Example**:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[I₁ = 5A] --> B((Node))
    C[I₂ = 2A] --> B
    B --> D[I₃ = 3A]
    B --> E[I₄ = 4A]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Applying KCL at node B:

- Currents entering: I₁ + I₂ = 5A + 2A = 7A
- Currents leaving: I₃ + I₄ = 3A + 4A = 7A
- Therefore: I₁ + I₂ - I₃ - I₄ = 5 + 2 - 3 - 4 = 0 ✓

**Mnemonic**: "CuNoZ: Currents at Node are Zero"

**Answer**:

**Thevenin's Theorem**: Any linear network with voltage and current sources can be replaced by an equivalent circuit consisting of a voltage source (VTH) in series with a resistance (RTH).

```mermaid

    end
    subgraph "Thevenin Equivalent"
    D((A)) --- E[VTH] --- F((\+))

    end
```

**Steps to Find Thevenin Equivalent**:

2. Calculate the open-circuit voltage (VOC) across these terminals (= VTH)
3. Calculate the resistance looking back into the circuit with all sources replaced by their internal resistances (= RTH)
4. The Thevenin equivalent consists of VTH in series with RTH

**Example Application**:

## Question 3(a) OR [3 marks]

**State and explain reciprocity theorem.**

**Answer**:

**Reciprocity Theorem**: In a linear, bilateral network, if a voltage source in one branch produces a current in another branch, then the same voltage source, if placed in the second branch, will produce the same current in the first branch.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Original Circuit"
    direction LR
    A((A)) --- B[V] --- C((B))

    direction LR
    G((A)) --- H[Ammeter] --- I((B))
    I --- J[Network] --- K((C))
    K --- L[V] --- G
    end
```

**Mathematically**: If a voltage V₁ in branch 1 produces current I₂ in branch 2, then voltage V₁ in branch 2 will produce current I₂ in branch 1.

**Limitations**: Applies only to networks with:

- Linear elements
- Bilateral elements (no diodes, transistors)

## Question 3(c) OR [7 marks]

**State and prove maximum power transfer theorem.**

**Answer**:

**Maximum Power Transfer Theorem**: A load connected to a source will extract maximum power when its resistance equals the internal resistance of the source.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A((\+)) --- B[VS] --- C((X))
    C --- D[RS] --- E((Y))
    E --- F[RL] --- G((Z))
    G --- A
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Proof**:

1. Current in the circuit: I = VS/(RS + RL)
2. Power delivered to load: P = I²RL = (VS²RL)/(RS + RL)²
3. For maximum power, dP/dRL = 0
4. Solving: (VS²(RS + RL)² - VS²RL·2(RS + RL))/(RS + RL)⁴ = 0
5. Simplifying: (RS + RL)² = 2RL(RS + RL)
6. Further simplifying: RS + RL = 2RL
7. Therefore: RS = RL

**Maximum Power**: Pmax = VS²/(4RS)

**Mnemonic**: "MaRLRS: Maximum power when load Resistance equals Source Resistance"

## Question 4(a) [3 marks]

**Why series resonance circuit act as voltage amplifier and parallel resonance circuit act as current amplifier?**

**Answer**:

**Series Resonance as Voltage Amplifier**:

- At resonance, series circuit impedance is minimum (just R)
- Voltage across L or C can be much larger than source voltage
- Voltage magnification factor = Q = XL/R = 1/R√(L/C)
- Voltage across L or C = Q × Source voltage

**Parallel Resonance as Current Amplifier**:

- At resonance, parallel circuit impedance is maximum
- Current in L or C can be much larger than source current
- Current magnification factor = Q = R/XL = R√(C/L)
- Current through L or C = Q × Source current

**Table**:

| Circuit Type | Impedance at Resonance | Amplification |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Series       | Minimum (R only)       | Voltage (VL or VC = Q×VS) |
| Parallel     | Maximum (R²/r)         | Current (IL or IC = Q×IS) |

graph LR
    A((A)) --- B[R] --- C((B))
    C --- D[L] --- A
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Derivation**:

1. Q-factor is defined as: Q = Energy stored / Energy dissipated per cycle
2. Energy stored in inductor = (1/2)LI²
3. Power dissipated in resistor = I²R
4. Energy dissipated per cycle = Power × Time period = I²R × (1/f)
5. Therefore: Q = ((1/2)LI²) / (I²R × (1/f))
6. Simplifying: Q = 2π × (1/2)LI² × f / (I²R)
7. Q = 2πf × L / R = ωL / R

**Final Equation**: Q = ωL / R = 2πfL / R = XL / R

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Derivation**:

1. Impedance of series RLC circuit: Z = R + j(XL - XC)
2. Where: XL = ωL and XC = 1/ωC
3. At resonance, XL = XC (inductive and capacitive reactances are equal)
4. Therefore: ωL = 1/ωC
5. Solving for ω: ω² = 1/LC
6. Resonant frequency: ω₀ = 1/√(LC)
7. In terms of frequency f: f₀ = 1/(2π√(LC))

**Characteristics at Resonance**:

- Impedance is minimum (purely resistive: Z = R)
- Current is maximum (I = V/R)
- Power factor is unity (circuit appears resistive)
- Voltages across L and C are equal and opposite

    D((C)) --- E[L2] --- F((D))
    G[M] -.-> B
    G -.-> E
    end
```

**Derivation**:

1. The mutual inductance (M) between two coils depends on:
   - Self-inductances of the coils (L₁ and L₂)
   - Physical arrangement (proximity and orientation)
2. Maximum possible mutual inductance: Mₘₐₓ = √(L₁L₂)

## Question 4(c) OR [7 marks]

**A series RLC circuit has R=30Ω, L=0.5H, and C=5µF. Calculate (i) series resonance frequency (2) Q Factor (3)BW**

**Answer**:

**Given**:

- Resistance, R = 30Ω
- Inductance, L = 0.5H
- Capacitance, C = 5µF = 5×10⁻⁶F

**Calculations**:

**(i) Series Resonance Frequency**:

- f₀ = 1/(2π√(LC))
- f₀ = 1/(2π√(0.5 × 5×10⁻⁶))
- f₀ = 1/(2π√(2.5×10⁻⁶))
- f₀ = 1/(2π × 1.58×10⁻³)
- f₀ = 1/(9.9×10⁻³)
- f₀ = 100.76 Hz
- f₀ ≈ 100 Hz

**(ii) Q Factor**:

- Q = (1/R)√(L/C)
- Q = (1/30)√(0.5/(5×10⁻⁶))
- Q = (1/30)√(100,000)
- Q = (1/30) × 316.23
- Q = 10.54

**(iii) Bandwidth (BW)**:

- BW = f₀/Q
- BW = 100.76/10.54
- BW = 9.56 Hz

**Table**:

| Parameter | Formula | Value |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Resonant Frequency (f₀) | 1/(2π√(LC)) | 100 Hz |
| Quality Factor (Q) | (1/R)√(L/C) | 10.54 |
| Bandwidth (BW) | f₀/Q | 9.56 Hz |

## Question 5(b) [4 marks]

**Derive relation between attenuator and neper.**

**Answer**:

**Relationship between Attenuation and Neper**:

- **Attenuation (α)**: Ratio of input voltage (or current) to output voltage (or current), expressed in different units.

- **Neper (Np)**: Natural logarithmic unit of ratios, used mainly in transmission line theory.

**Derivation**:

1. For a voltage ratio V₁/V₂:
   - Attenuation in Nepers = ln(V₁/V₂)
   - Attenuation in Decibels = 20log₁₀(V₁/V₂)

2. For a power ratio P₁/P₂:
   - Attenuation in Nepers = (1/2)ln(P₁/P₂)
   - Attenuation in Decibels = 10log₁₀(P₁/P₂)

3. Relationship between dB and Neper:
   - 1 Neper = 8.686 dB
   - 1 dB = 0.115 Neper

**Table**:

| Unit | Voltage Ratio | Power Ratio |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| Neper (Np) | ln(V₁/V₂) | (1/2)ln(P₁/P₂) |
| Decibel (dB) | 20log₁₀(V₁/V₂) | 10log₁₀(P₁/P₂) |

    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Derivation**:

1. For a symmetrical T-attenuator with characteristic impedance Z₀:
   - Input and output impedance must both equal Z₀
   - Attenuation ratio N = V₁/V₂ = I₂/I₁

2. From circuit analysis:
   - Z₀ = R₁ + (R₂(R₁))/(R₂+R₁)
   - N = (R₁ + R₂ + R₁)/R₂ = (2R₁+R₂)/R₂

3. Solving for R₁ and R₂:
   - R₁ = Z₀(N-1)/(N+1)
   - R₂ = 2Z₀N/(N²-1)

4. For attenuation in dB (α):
   - N = 10^(α/20)
   - R₁ = Z₀·tanh(α/2)
   - R₂ = Z₀/sinh(α)

**Final Equations**:

- R₁ = Z₀(N-1)/(N+1)
- R₂ = 2Z₀N/(N²-1)

   Input              Output
```

**Derivation of Cutoff Frequency**:

1. For a constant-K filter:
   - Z₁ × Z₂ = R₀² (characteristic impedance squared)
   - Z₁ = jωL (series impedance)
   - Z₂ = 1/jωC (shunt impedance)

2. Therefore:
   - R₀² = Z₁ × Z₂ = jωL × 1/jωC = L/C
   - R₀ = √(L/C)

3. Pass band condition:
   - -1 < Z₁/4Z₂ < 0
   - -1 < jωL/(4 × 1/jωC) < 0
   - -1 < -ω²LC/4 < 0

4. At cutoff frequency:
   - ω²LC/4 = 1
   - ωc² = 4/LC
   - ωc = 2/√(LC)
   - fc = ωc/2π = 1/π√(LC)

**Final Equation**:

- Cutoff frequency fc = 1/π√(LC)
