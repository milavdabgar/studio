  "rationale": "C forms the basics of C++, C#, Visual C/C++ etc. which is current requirement in the information technology (IT) and computer science (CS). It is one of the most commonly used programming language in industry by engineers. It is a middle level language which combines features of both the high level and low level language. It is widely used to develop system programming, operating systems, embedded systems. Also, C is used for creating computer applications that are used in writing embedded software/firmware for various micro-controllers based products in electronics, industrial and communications. C is also used in developing verification software, test code and simulators for various applications and hardware products. It is therefore very important for electronic engineers to develop mastery over C language.",
