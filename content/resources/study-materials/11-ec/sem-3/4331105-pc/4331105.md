## 1. RATIONALE

C forms the basics of C++, C#, Visual C/C++ etc. which is current requirement in  the  information  technology  (IT)  and  computer  science  (CS).  It  is  one  of  the  most commonly  used  programming  language  in  industry  by  engineers.  It  is  a  middle  level language which combines features of both the high level and low level language. It is widely used  to  develop  system  programming,  operating  systems,  embedded  systems.  Also,  C  is used for creating computer applications that are used in writing embedded software/firmware  for  various  micro-controllers  based  products  in  electronics,  industrial and  communications.  C  is  also  used  in  developing  verification  software,  test  code  and simulators for various applications and hardware products. It is therefore very important for electronic engineers to develop mastery over C language.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The course should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop different types of skills leading to the achievement of the following competencies:

-  Develop programs in C language.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

-  Develop algorithm and flowchart for simple problems.
-  Use operators and I/O functions to write C programs.
-  Develop C programs using decision and control statement.
- Develop C programs using pointer and array operation.

-  Develop C programs using library function and structure.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow safety practices while using electrical appliances and computer.
- c) Practice environmentally friendly methods and processes. (Environment related)
- d) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises.  Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in  order  development  of  the  COs  and  competency  is  not  missed  out  by  the studentsand  teachers.  If  required,  more  such  higher  level  UOs  could  be  included  by  the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Rapid code development and debugging competition
- b) Technical Quiz, Multiple Choice Questions Test etc. may be used.
- c) Mini Project using Programming in C Language

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- c) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- d) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- e) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using Programming.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Design algorithm and construct a flowchart for at least 4 problems
- b) Prepare charts to explain use/process of the identified topic.
- c) Students  are  encouraged  to  register  themselves  in  various  MOOCs  such  as: Swayam, edx, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.
- d) Encourage students to participate in different coding competitions like hackathon, online competitions on codechef etc.
