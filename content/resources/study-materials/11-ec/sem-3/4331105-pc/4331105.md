Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)
Semester-III
Course Title: Programming In C
- Course Code: 4331105)

Diploma programme in which this course is offered           Semester in which offered
Electronics and Communication Engineering                         Third

## 1. Rationale

C forms the basics of C++, C#, Visual C/C++ etc. which is current requirement
in the information technology (IT) and computer science (CS). It is one of the most
commonly used programming language in industry by engineers. It is a middle level
language which combines features of both the high level and low level language. It is widely
used to develop system programming, operating systems, embedded systems. Also, C is
used for creating computer applications that are used in writing embedded
software/firmware for various micro-controllers based products in electronics, industrial
and communications. C is also used in developing verification software, test code and
simulators for various applications and hardware products. It is therefore very important
for electronic engineers to develop mastery over C language.

## 2. Competency

The course should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop different types of
skills leading to the achievement of the following competencies:
- Develop programs in C language.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

- Develop algorithm and flowchart for simple problems.
- Use operators and I/O functions to write C programs.
- Develop C programs using decision and control statement.
- Develop C programs using pointer and array operation.
- Develop C programs using library function and structure.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of
## Practical Outcomes

```
        the above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development
        of this competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow safety practices while using electrical appliances and computer.
- Practice environmentally friendly methods and processes. (Environment related)
- Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
studentsand teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- Rapid code development and debugging competition
- Technical Quiz, Multiple Choice Questions Test etc. may be used.
- Mini Project using Programming in C Language

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using
Programming
- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested
student- related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the
attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following
activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also
collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their
placement interviews:
- Design algorithm and construct a flowchart for at least 4 problems
- Prepare charts to explain use/process of the identified topic.
- Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as:
Swayam, edx, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.
- Encourage students to participate in different coding competitions like
hackathon, online competitions on codechef etc.
