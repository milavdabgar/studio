## 1. RATIONALE

C forms the basics of C++, C#, Visual C/C++ etc. which is current requirement in  the  information  technology  (IT)  and  computer  science  (CS).  It  is  one  of  the  most commonly  used  programming  language  in  industry  by  engineers.  It  is  a  middle  level language which combines features of both the high level and low level language. It is widely used  to  develop  system  programming,  operating  systems,  embedded  systems.  Also,  C  is used for creating computer applications that are used in writing embedded software/firmware  for  various  micro-controllers  based  products  in  electronics,  industrial and  communications.  C  is  also  used  in  developing  verification  software,  test  code  and simulators for various applications and hardware products. It is therefore very important for electronic engineers to develop mastery over C language.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The course should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop different types of skills leading to the achievement of the following competencies:

- Develop programs in C language.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

- Develop algorithm and flowchart for simple problems.
- Use operators and I/O functions to write C programs.
- Develop C programs using decision and control statement.
- Develop C programs using pointer and array operation.

- Develop C programs using library function and structure.
