| w. e. f. Academic Year: | 2024-25 |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| Semester:               | 3 rd    |
| Category of the Course: | ESC     |

**Prerequisite:**

1. Basic computer literacy: Students should be familiar with how to use a computer, create and manage files, and use a web browser.
2. Basic problem-solving skills: Programming involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable ones.
3. Logical thinking: Programming requires you to be able to think logically and follow instructions carefully.

**Rationale:**

C language is a basic programming language for enhancing the student's logical and problem-solving  ability  of  students.  It  is  one  of  the  most  used  middle  level programming  languages  in industry. It is widely used to develop system programming, operating systems, embedded systems. Also, C is used for creating computer  applications  that  are  used  in  writing  embedded  software/firmware  for various micro-controller-based products in electronics, industrial and communications. C language is also used in developing verification software, test code and simulators for various applications and hardware products. This course enhances and builds confidence in the programming skills of diploma students. This course will enable students to inculcate programming concepts and methodology to solve engineering problems.
