  "rationale": "C language is a basic programming language for enhancing the student's logical and problem-solving ability of students. It is one of the most used middle level programming languages in industry. It is widely used to develop system programming, operating systems, embedded systems. Also, C is used for creating computer applications that are used in writing embedded software/firmware for various micro-controller-based products in electronics, industrial and communications. C language is also used in developing verification software, test code and simulators for various applications and hardware products. This course enhances and builds confidence in the programming skills of diploma students. This course will enable students to inculcate programming concepts and methodology to solve engineering problems.",
