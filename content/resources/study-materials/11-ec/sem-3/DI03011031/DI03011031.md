## Note :

- i.  More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a suggestive list.
- ii.   The following are some sample 'Process' and 'Product' related skills(more may be added/deleted depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises of this course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

## Suggested Micro Projects:

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, workshop-based, laboratory based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission . The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs. A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a)  Build a small circuit on bread board for Thevenin and Norton theorems.
- b)  Build a constant K low pass passive filter on bread board
- c)  Build a constant K high pass passive filter on bread board
- d)  Build a small circuit for 30 V DC measurement using PMMC meter
- e)  Build a simple circuit to measure DC voltage using ICL 7107 or MAX07
- f)  Build a small circuit for 300 V ac measurement using PMMC meter
- g)  Build a simple counter circuit for measuring line frequency (50 Hz)
- h)  Build a simple circuit for measurement of displacement using optical encoder
9. i ) Build a simple circuit for measurement of room temperature using LM35
- j)  Build a simple circuit of function generator using IC 8038 or XR2206
- k)  Disposal of old instruments - Prepare a chart or report on handling, recycling and disposal of old instruments with figures, tables and comparative charts and strategies used or suggested.

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a)  Prepare specification of electronics instruments.
- b)  Give seminars on DSO, MSO, Various transducers and sensors.
- c)  Undertake a market survey of different electronics instruments.
- d)  Prepare plan for disposal of E-waste of old and non-use electronic instruments as per  GPCB and CPCB guidelines.
