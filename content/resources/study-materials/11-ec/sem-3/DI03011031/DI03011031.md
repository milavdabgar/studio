Suggested Micro Projects:
- Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be
assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he
contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for
micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.
                 The micro-project could be industry application based, workshop-based, laboratory
based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an
integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting
of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission.
The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours
during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop
the industry oriented COs. A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the
competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Build a small circuit on bread board for Thevenin and Norton theorems.
- Build a constant K low pass passive filter on bread board
- Build a constant K high pass passive filter on bread board
- Build a small circuit for 30 V DC measurement using PMMC meter
- Build a simple circuit to measure DC voltage using ICL 7107 or MAX07
- Build a small circuit for 300 V ac measurement using PMMC meter
- Build a simple counter circuit for measuring line frequency (50 Hz)
- Build a simple circuit for measurement of displacement using optical encoder
i ) Build a simple circuit for measurement of room temperature using LM35
- Build a simple circuit of function generator using IC 8038 or XR2206
- Disposal of old instruments – Prepare a chart or report on handling, recycling and
    disposal of old instruments with figures, tables and comparative charts and strategies
    used or suggested.

Suggested Activities for Students:
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages
for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which will be
useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare specification of electronics instruments.
- Give seminars on DSO, MSO, Various transducers and sensors.
- Undertake a market survey of different electronics instruments.
- Prepare plan for disposal of E-waste of old and non-use electronic instruments as
per GPCB and CPCB guidelines.
