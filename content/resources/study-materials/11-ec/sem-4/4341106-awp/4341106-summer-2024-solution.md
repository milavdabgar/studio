## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Define Beam Area and Beam Efficiency.**

**Answer**:

**Beam Area**: The solid angle through which all of the power radiated by an antenna would flow if the radiation intensity was constant throughout this angle and equal to the maximum value.

**Beam Efficiency**: The ratio of the power contained in the main beam to the total power radiated by the antenna.

**Diagram**:

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Explain Kepler's 3rd law.**

**Answer**:

Kepler's 3rd law relates the orbital period of a satellite to its semi-major axis.

**Formula**: T² = (4π²/GM) × a³

Where:

- T = orbital period
- a = semi-major axis
- G = gravitational constant
- M = mass of central body

**Diagram**:

```mermaid

- **Meaning**: Larger orbits have longer periods
- **Application**: Determines satellite orbit characteristics
- **Geostationary orbit**: Period = 24 hours, altitude ≈ 35,786 km
