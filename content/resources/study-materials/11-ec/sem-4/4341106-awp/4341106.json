  "rationale": "Antennas play a vital role in wireless communication as a terminal component of transmitter and receiver systems. The quality of signals at receiver depends on type of transmitting and receiving antennas, their orientation, transmitting frequency and geographical terrain. For installation & maintenance of wireless systems, the basic knowledge of wave propagation theory is essential. This course will help the students to select and install antennas of desired operating frequency for the particular application. It is therefore a core engineering course for EC engineers and hence students should learn this course for efficient working in the wireless communication field.",
  "competency": "The course content should be taught and with the aim to develop different types of skills so that students are able to acquire following competency: Identify the appropriate antenna and use them for specific wireless communication applications.",
