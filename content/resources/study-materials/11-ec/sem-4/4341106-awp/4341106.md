Electronics and Communication Engineering                     4th Semester

## 1. Rationale

Antennas play vital role in wireless communication as a terminal component of transmitter
and receiver systems. The quality of signals at receiver depends on type of transmitting
and receiving antennas, their orientation, transmitting frequency and geographical terrain.
For installation & maintenance of wireless systems the basic knowledge of wave
propagation theory is essential. This course will help the students to select and install
antennas of desired operating frequency for the particular application. It is therefore a core
engineering course for EC engineers and hence students should learn this course for
efficient working in the wireless communication field.

## 2. Competency

The course content should be taught and with the aim to develop different types of skills so
that students are able to acquire following competency

- Identify the appropriate antenna and use them for specific wireless
communication applications.
## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of
the following COs:

- Interpret electromagnetic wave radiation by elementary antenna with
related parameters.
- Select the different antenna arrays for the specific application.
- Select the antennas for indoor/outdoor and special applications.
- Select the antenna positioning for specific mode of wave propagation.
- Identify the concepts of satellite communication and its applications.

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.

-      Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow safety practices while using electrical, electronics, pneumatic instruments
        and tools.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy ’
should gradually increase as planned below:

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- Prepare the chart of various antenna radiation patterns.
- Collect details of different types of antenna parameters used in radio/TV
transmitter, cellular system, wireless radio set, Radar.
- Prepare the demonstration model of commonly used antennas.
- To prepare the chart for Morse code and phonetics.
- To prepare chart/PPT of applications of antenna as per HF/VHF/UHF and special
wireless communication.
- Prepare the PPT/animations of 3-D radiation pattern and wave propagation of
radio waves.
- Undertakeliteraturesurveyandinternetsearchandalsohandbook/datasheets
eachfor specifications of given antenna.
- InstallandcommissionDTHsystems.
- Visit Satellite Earth Station (SAC)/ Doordarshan / AIR/ FM Radio Station.
- HAM radio demonstration workshop.

Antenna & Wave Propagation                                                   Course Code: 4341106

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:

- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- In Unit I & II, the fundamental wave propagation equations and formulas of
electromagnetic wave propagation theory can be explained without mathematical
derivations.
- For Unit III, IV & V the teacher should arrange visits to different communication
research laboratories as well as state of art industries to justify and reinforce the theory
taught.
- To familiarizing the working of various type of antennas demonstrate the use of
radiation measuring meter , radiation generation instrument and various types of antennas
as listed in unit III to the students in the lab period.
- Introduce the latest simulation software (HFSS, CST etc.) for better understanding of
radiation pattern of various types of antennas.
- To support and enhance the understanding of the fundamental theory of wave
propagation in unit I & V, use of animations and simulation software are recommended.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature can be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

-     To prepare demonstrative models of different antennas ( i.e Dish, Yagi-Uda, Dipole,
Helix)
-     To prepare mobile signal strength booster for antennas.
-     To fabricate code practise oscillator on PCB using 555 timer.
-     To prepare chart for recent trends of antenna applications i.e PCB mounted
miniature antennas ,Automobile antennas, Car Keys antennas, Wi fi adaptor antennas, LORA
antennas, IOT gateways antennas etc.
