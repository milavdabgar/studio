## 1. RATIONALE

Antennas play vital role in wireless communication as a terminal component of transmitter and receiver systems. The quality of signals at receiver depends on type of transmitting and receiving antennas, their orientation, transmitting frequency and geographical terrain. For  installation  &amp;  maintenance  of  wireless  systems  the  basic  knowledge  of  wave propagation theory  is  essential.  This  course  will  help  the  students  to  select  and  install antennas of desired operating frequency for the particular application. It is therefore a core engineering  course  for  EC  engineers  and  hence  students  should  learn  this  course  for efficient working in the wireless communication field.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The course content should be taught and with the aim to develop different types of skills so that students are able to acquire following competency

- ï‚· Identify the appropriate antenna and use them for specific wireless communication applications.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of the following COs:

- a) Interpret electromagnetic wave radiation by elementary antenna with related parameters.
- b) Select the different antenna arrays for the specific application.
- c) Select the antennas for indoor/outdoor and special applications.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy ' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level 'in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level 'in 2 nd year.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- ï‚· Prepare the chart of various antenna radiation patterns.
- ï‚· Collect  details  of  different  types  of  antenna  parameters  used  in  radio/TV transmitter, cellular system, wireless radio set, Radar.
- ï‚· Prepare the demonstration model of commonly used antennas.
- ï‚· To prepare the chart for Morse code and phonetics.
- ï‚· To prepare chart/PPT of applications of antenna as per HF/VHF/UHF and special wireless communication.
- ï‚· Prepare the PPT/animations of 3-D radiation pattern and wave propagation of radio waves.
- ï‚· Undertakeliteraturesurveyandinternetsearchandalsohandbook/datasheets eachfor specifications of given antenna.
- ï‚· InstallandcommissionDTHsystems.
- ï‚· Visit Satellite Earth Station (SAC)/ Doordarshan / AIR/ FM Radio Station.
- ï‚· HAM radio demonstration workshop.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive  open  online  courses  ( MOOCs )  may  be  used  to  teach  various  topics/sub topics.
- b) In  Unit  I  &amp;  II,  the  fundamental  wave  propagation  equations  and  formulas  of electromagnetic wave  propagation  theory can be explained without mathematical derivations.
- c) For  Unit  III,  IV  &amp;  V  the  teacher  should  arrange  visits  to  different  communication research laboratories as well as state of art industries to justify and reinforce the theory taught.
- d) To familiarizing  the  working  of  various  type  of  antennas  demonstrate  the  use  of radiation measuring meter , radiation generation instrument and various types of antennas as listed in unit III to the students in the lab period.
- e) Introduce the latest simulation software (HFSS, CST etc.) for better understanding of radiation pattern of various types of antennas.
- f) To  support  and  enhance  the  understanding  of  the  fundamental  theory  of  wave propagation in unit I &amp; V, use of animations and simulation software are recommended.
- g) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- h) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- i) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature can be given to the students for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed using different assessment methods.
- j) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) To prepare demonstrative models of different antennas ( i.e Dish, Yagi-Uda, Dipole, Helix)
- b) To prepare mobile signal strength booster for antennas.
- c) To fabricate code practise oscillator on PCB using 555 timer.
- d) To  prepare  chart  for  recent  trends  of  antenna  applications  i.e  PCB  mounted miniature antennas ,Automobile antennas, Car Keys antennas, Wi fi adaptor antennas, LORA antennas, IOT gateways antennas etc.
