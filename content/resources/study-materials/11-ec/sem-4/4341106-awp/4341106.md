## 1. RATIONALE

Antennas play a vital role in wireless communication as a terminal component of transmitter and receiver systems. The quality of signals at receiver depends on type of transmitting and receiving antennas, their orientation, transmitting frequency and geographical terrain. For installation & maintenance of wireless systems, the basic knowledge of wave propagation theory is essential. This course will help the students to select and install antennas of desired operating frequency for the particular application. It is therefore a core engineering course for EC engineers and hence students should learn this course for efficient working in the wireless communication field.

## 2. COMPETENCY

- j) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) To prepare demonstrative models of different antennas ( i.e Dish, Yagi-Uda, Dipole, Helix)
- b) To prepare mobile signal strength booster for antennas.
- c) To fabricate code practise oscillator on PCB using 555 timer.
- d) To  prepare  chart  for  recent  trends  of  antenna  applications  i.e  PCB  mounted miniature antennas ,Automobile antennas, Car Keys antennas, Wi fi adaptor antennas, LORA antennas, IOT gateways antennas etc.
