| Properties of Electromagnetic Waves |
|:-----------------------------------|
| 1. EM waves can travel through vacuum or material media |

**Answer**:

| Term | Definition |
|:-----|:-----------|
| **Radiation resistance** | The equivalent resistance that would dissipate the same amount of power as radiated by an antenna when the current at the feed point is equal to the antenna input current |
| **Directivity** | The ratio of maximum radiation intensity in a specific direction to the average radiation intensity in all directions |
| **Gain** | The product of directivity and radiation efficiency, measuring how efficiently an antenna converts input power into radio waves in a specific direction |

## Question 5(a) OR [3 marks]

**Write laws of Kepler for satellite**

**Answer**:

| Kepler's Laws | Description |
|:--------------|:------------|
| **First Law** | Satellites orbit in elliptical paths with the Earth at one focus of the ellipse |
