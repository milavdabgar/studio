    B -->|Produces| C[Time-varying Magnetic Field]
    C -->|Produces| D[Time-varying Electric Field]
    D --> C
    C --> E[Self-sustaining EM Wave]
```

```

- **Center Feeding**: AC signal applied at center of dipole creates oscillating current
- **Charge Distribution**: Current creates opposite charges at dipole ends that change with AC frequency

  - Helical designs for flexibility
- **Internal Antennas**: Now dominant in handsets
  - PIFA (Planar Inverted-F Antenna)s
  - PCB trace antennas
  - Characteristics:
    - Small size
    - Multi-band operation
    - Omnidirectional pattern
    - Lower efficiency (typically -3 to -6 dBi)
