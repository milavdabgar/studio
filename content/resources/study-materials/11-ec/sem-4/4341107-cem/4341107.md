Diploma programmer in which this course is offered                    Semester in which offered
Electronics and Communication Engineering                               4th Semester

## 1. Rationale

In developing nations demand of consumer electronic appliances is increasing day by day. This requires
large number of technically trained men power in relevant industries. Equipments with electronic
circuitry are increasingly being used in all the Industry and maintenance of them is the essential work for
the proper functioning of the complete system. Looking towards the need of the country, in-depth
knowledge for maintaining various electronics audio-video systems and home appliances is necessary
for diploma engineering students. This subject will introduce the students with working principles, block
diagram and advance features of consumer electronics appliances, which in-turn will develop skills to
diagnosis fault and rectification of that in systematic way. This course will enable the students to
develop skills to maintain the basic electronic circuitry used in the equipments, which are employed in
Industry and in consumer goods segments.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency
through various teaching learning experiences:

- Maintain and troubleshoot various consumer electronic domestic/office appliances.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs):

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with the
identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of the following COs:
1) Select relevant microphones and loudspeakers.
2) Test working of various colour TV.
3) Describe functionality of various electronic domestic appliances.
4) Describe functionality of various electronic office appliances.
5) Follow standard maintenance procedures to maintain various domestic and office appliances.

mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this course competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
- Follow safety precautions.
- Realize importance of E-waste management
The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of
achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should gradually
increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory
The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If required, more such UOs
could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

- 0. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES:

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course:
Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each
activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be
useful for their placement interviews.

Consumer Electronics & Maintenance                            Course Code: 4341107

For micro project reports should be as per suggested format, for other activities students and teachers
together can decide the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidences
such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their
placement interviews:
- Troubleshoot the common consumer electronics products like digital TV, Washing machine,
microwave oven, refrigerator, MF printer, Air conditioner etc.
- Conduct market survey for latest home appliances and compare specifications of reputed
brands and prepare a report.
- Diagnose fault in the non working home appliance and rectify that.
- Discuss case study of any fault detection and rectification problem.
- Maintain the office/domestic electronic equipments.
- Make visit to service centers of gadgets/equipment covered in curriculum and if possible work
there for some days on voluntarily basis during holidays.
- Search internet websites for DYS (Do Your Self) information for repair of electronic
gadgets/equipment or collect manuals for repair and maintenance and try your hands to repair
some gadgets/equipment based on that.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any):
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:

- Arrange demonstration sessions of maintaining equipment/gadgets in labs by inviting
engineers/technicians working in service centers of reputed makes as visiting lecturers for lab
- Show video/animation films to demonstrate the working principles, constructional features,
testing and maintenance procedures of various home appliances.
- Show video/animation film explaining different field applications of PLC, DCS and SCADA.
- Prepare a chart related to PLC, DCS and SCADA Hierarchy
- Arrange a visit to nearby manufacturer of consumer electronics products.
- Arrange visit to repair centers of reputed makes of consumer goods suppliers.
- Implement value addition circuits for the consumer electronic product based on Innovative
ideas.
- Arrange group discussions on the troubleshooting of electronic equipment issues.
- Arrange seminar on safety and maintenance issues (ask students to explore the internet and
visit nearby industries to collect information regarding the chosen topic/issue)

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS:

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her
in the beginning of the semester. The micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5 students). The
micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or
field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of

PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual
contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration

Consumer Electronics & Maintenance                              Course Code: 4341107

of the micro project should be about 14- 16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the
course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-
oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar
micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Build a circuit for continuity tester with buzzer and LED indicator.
- Build a circuit of DC voltage regulator on general purpose PCB.
- Trace the circuit of DC power supply, create faults in diodes, resistor, capacitor, voltage
        regulator IC etc and diagnose the faults and rectify it.
- Prepare reports on operation and maintenance of photovoltaic and Energy Storage Systems.
- Prepare reports on operation and maintenance of microwave oven.
- Prepare testing charts of active components like diode, transistor, SCR, TRIAC etc.
