## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following  sample  Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the  abovementioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this course competency.

a) Work as a leader/a team member
b) Follow ethical practices
c) Follow safety precautions
d) Realize importance of E-waste management

The  ADOs  are  best  developed  through  the  laboratory/field  based  exercises.  Moreover,  the  level  of achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy'  should  gradually increase as planned below:

- **Valuing Level** in 1st year
- **Organization Level** in 2nd year
- **Characterization Level** in 3rd year

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

The  major  underpinning  theory  is  given  below  based  on  the  higher  level  UOs  of  Revised  Bloom's taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  student  related  cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews.

For micro project reports should be as per suggested format, for other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Troubleshoot  the  common  consumer  electronics  products  like  digital  TV,  Washing  machine, microwave oven, refrigerator, MF printer, Air conditioner etc.
- b) Conduct  market  survey  for  latest  home  appliances  and  compare  specifications  of  reputed brands and prepare a report.
- c) Diagnose fault in the non working home appliance and rectify that.
- d) Discuss case study of any fault detection and rectification problem.
- e) Maintain the office/domestic electronic equipments.
- f) Make visit to service centers of gadgets/equipment covered in curriculum and if possible work there for some days on voluntarily basis during holidays.
- g) Search internet websites for DYS (Do Your Self) information for repair of electronic gadgets/equipment or collect manuals for repair and maintenance and try your hands to repair some gadgets/equipment based on that.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These  are  sample  strategies,  which  the  teacher  can  use  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the  various outcomes in this course:

- a) Arrange demonstration sessions of maintaining equipment/gadgets in labs by inviting engineers/technicians working in service centers of reputed makes as visiting lecturers for lab sessions
- b) Show  video/animation  films  to  demonstrate  the  working  principles,  constructional  features, testing and maintenance procedures of various home appliances.
- c) Show video/animation film explaining different field applications of PLC, DCS and SCADA.
- d) Prepare a chart related to PLC, DCS and SCADA Hierarchy
- e) Arrange a visit to nearby manufacturer of consumer electronics products.
- f) Arrange visit to repair centers of reputed makes of consumer goods suppliers.
- g) Implement  value  addition  circuits  for  the  consumer  electronic  product  based  on  Innovative ideas.
- h) Arrange group discussions on the troubleshooting of electronic equipment issues.
- i) Arrange seminar on safety and maintenance issues (ask students to explore the internet and visit nearby industries to collect information regarding the chosen topic/issue)

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in  the  beginning of the semester. The micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5 students). The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to  maintain  dated  work  diary  consisting  of  individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration

of the micro project should be about 14- 16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industryoriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Build a circuit for continuity tester with buzzer and LED indicator.
- b) Build a circuit of DC voltage regulator on general purpose PCB.
- c) Trace  the  circuit  of  DC  power  supply,  create  faults  in  diodes,  resistor,  capacitor,  voltage regulator IC etc and diagnose the faults and rectify it.
- d) Prepare reports on operation and maintenance of photovoltaic and Energy Storage Systems.
- e) Prepare reports on operation and maintenance of microwave oven.
- f) Prepare testing charts of active components like diode, transistor, SCR, TRIAC etc.
