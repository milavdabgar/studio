  "rationale": "In developing nations demand of consumer electronic appliances is increasing day by day. This requires large number of technically trained men power in relevant industries. Equipments with electronic circuitry are increasingly being used in all the Industry and maintenance of them is the essential work for the proper functioning of the complete system. Looking towards the need of the country, in-depth knowledge for maintaining various electronics audio-video systems and home appliances is necessary for diploma engineering students. This subject will introduce the students with working principles, block diagram and advance features of consumer electronics appliances, which in-turn will develop skills to diagnosis fault and rectification of that in systematic way. This course will enable the students to develop skills to maintain the basic electronic circuitry used in the equipments, which are employed in Industry and in consumer goods segments.",
  "competency": "The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences: Maintain and troubleshoot various consumer electronic domestic/office appliances.",
