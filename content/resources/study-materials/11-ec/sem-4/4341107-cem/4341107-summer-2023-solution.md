## Question 5(c) [7 marks]

**Explain Crystal microphone.**

**Answer**:

**Table: Crystal Microphone Characteristics**

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Operating Principle** | Piezoelectric effect |
| **Construction** | Crystal element (Rochelle salt) between metal plates |
| **Response** | High output, moderate frequency response |
| **Impedance** | Very high (typically > 1 MΩ) |
| **Durability** | Sensitive to heat and humidity |

**Working Principle:**
When sound waves strike the diaphragm, they create pressure on the crystal element. Due to the piezoelectric effect, the crystal generates a voltage proportional to the mechanical stress. This voltage is the electrical representation of the sound.

**Applications:**

- Telephone receivers
- Contact pickups for acoustic instruments
- Low-cost recording devices
- Public address systems

**Advantages and Limitations:**

| Advantages | Limitations |
|------------|-------------|
| High output voltage | Poor frequency response |
| No external power needed | Sensitive to temperature/humidity |
| Simple construction | Higher distortion |
| Low cost | Fragile crystal element |

## Question 5(b OR) [4 marks]

**Explain optical sound recording.**

**Answer**:

**Table: Optical Sound Recording Process**

| Step | Process | Component |
|------|---------|-----------|
| 1 | **Sound Capture** | Microphone converts sound to electrical signals |
| 2 | **Modulation** | Signal modulates light source intensity or area |
| 3 | **Exposure** | Modulated light exposes photographic film |
| 4 | **Development** | Film processed to create visible sound track |
| 5 | **Playback** | Light passes through track, photodetector converts to electrical signal |

**Types of Optical Sound Tracks:**

- **Variable Density**: Light intensity varies (darker/lighter areas)
- **Variable Area**: Transparent area width varies against opaque background

## Question 5(c OR) [7 marks]

**Define loudspeaker. List types of loudspeakers and explain working of any one type of loudspeaker.**

**Answer**:

**Definition:**
A loudspeaker is an electroacoustic transducer that converts electrical signals into sound waves by moving a diaphragm that creates air pressure variations.

**Table: Types of Loudspeakers**

| Type | Working Principle | Frequency Range | Applications |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Dynamic/Moving Coil** | Electromagnetic induction | 20Hz-20kHz | Most common, general purpose |
| **Electrostatic** | Electrostatic force between plates | 100Hz-20kHz | High-fidelity audio systems |
| **Piezoelectric** | Piezoelectric effect | 1kHz-25kHz | Tweeters, alarms, buzzers |
| **Ribbon** | Current through ribbon in magnetic field | 2kHz-50kHz | High-frequency reproduction |
| **Planar Magnetic** | Magnetic force on conductor sheet | 30Hz-20kHz | Audiophile headphones, speakers |

**Working of Dynamic/Moving Coil Loudspeaker:**

```mermaid

    C --> E[Movement of Voice Coil]
    E --> F[Cone/Diaphragm Movement]
    F --> G[Air Pressure Variations]
    G --> H[Sound Waves]
```

**Working Process:**

1. Audio current flows through voice coil
2. Current creates electromagnetic field
3. Electromagnetic field interacts with permanent magnet
4. Voice coil moves forward/backward based on signal polarity
5. Attached cone/diaphragm moves, creating air pressure variations
6. Air pressure variations propagate as sound waves

**Components:**

- **Cone/Diaphragm**: Moves air to create sound
- **Voice Coil**: Carries audio signal current
- **Magnet**: Creates static magnetic field
- **Suspension**: Keeps cone centered, allows movement
- **Frame/Basket**: Holds components in proper alignment
