2. Prepare chart to represent the block diagram of different interfacing chips
3. Develop a practical application using 8051 Microcontroller
4. Prepare General purpose board with all ports available as connector
5. Prepare/Download a dynamic animation to illustrate the following:
   - Data transfer operation
   - Keypad Interfacing
   - LCD Interfacing
   - DC Motor Interfacing

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects
c) Some of the topics/sub-topics are relatively simple and very easy for students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods
d) With respect to section No.09, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities
e) Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine
f) Arrange visit to relevant industry
g) Show video lectures on Microcontroller Applications with help of internet
h) Assembly level programming practices on simulators (free downloadable)

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based.  However,  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters,  it  should  be  preferably  be individually undertaken  to  build  up  the  skill  and  confidence  in  every  student  to  become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a  seminar  presentation  of  it  before  submission.  The  total  duration  of  the  micro-project should  not  be  less  than 16  (sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The

student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industryoriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.

## MICRO PROJECT 1: Prepare following Items

1. Prepare Table for Instruction classification.
2. Design a chart of 8085/8051 Architecture.

## MIICRO PROJECT 2: Prepare following Designs

1. Design minimum hardware system for 8051 circuit.
2. Develop 8051 based application board/circuit on PCB.
