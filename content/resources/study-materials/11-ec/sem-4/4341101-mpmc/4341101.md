Diploma programme in which this course is offered              Semester in which offered
Electronics & Communication Engineering                         4th Semester

## 1. Rationale

The engineering technologists (i.e. diploma engineering holders) have to develop skills for
system design of Automatic circuit operations in various fields. Microprocessors &
Microcontroller are the sole of all embedded electronic equipment and are used in most of
the areas of electronics. They include product ranges from tiny consumer electronic
products to complex industrial process controllers. A diploma engineer needs to maintain
such systems. Programming practices will further help the students to develop indigenous
microcontroller-based applications. Hence this course is designed to achieve the system
maintenance competency among students.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:

- Maintain microprocessor-based system.

- Maintain microcontroller-based system/equipment.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The theory should be taught and practical should be carried out in such a manner that
students are able to acquire different learning outcomes in cognitive, psychomotor and
affective domain to demonstrate following course outcomes.

-     Identify basic features of microprocessor
ii.     Explain architecture and working of microprocessor
iii.     Illustrate microcontroller internal architecture
iv.      Write and execute assembly language programs(software) for given application
-      Interface microcontroller with hardware for given application

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular
activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in

Microprocessor & Microcontroller                                               Course Code: 4341101

this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of each
activity.

- Prepare journals based on practical performed in laboratory.
ii) Prepare chart to represent the block diagram of different interfacing chips. Develop a
practical application using 8051 Microcontroller
iv) Prepare General purpose board with all ports available as connector                         v)
Prepare/Download a dynamic animation to illustrate the following

- Data transfer operation • Keypad Interfacing
- LCD Interfacing.     • DC Motor Interfacing

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- Some of the topics/sub-topics is relatively simple and very easy to the students for
self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.09, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine.
- Arrange visit to relevant industry
- Show video lectures on Microcontroller Applications with help of internet.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more

- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give
a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project
should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The

 student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-
 oriented COs.
        A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.

- ICRO PROJECT 1: Prepare following Items.
```

1. Prepare Table for Instruction classification.
2. Design a chart of 8085/8051 Architecture.

- IICRO PROJECT 2: Prepare following Designs.
1. Design minimum hardware system for 8051 circuit.
2. Develop 8051 based application board/circuit on PCB.
