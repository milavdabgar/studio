## Basic Components of a Digital Computer

![Basic Components of a Digital Computer](/resources/study-materials/11-ec/sem-4/4341101-mpmc/imgs//871c3be60335b53b.jpg)

A digital computer is a versatile device capable of performing calculations and logical operations at incredible speeds. To achieve this, a computer relies on several fundamental components working together:

- **Input Unit:** This unit bridges the gap between the user and the computer. It allows data and instructions to be entered into the system. Some common input devices include:

  - Keyboard
  - Mouse
  - Touchscreen
  - Scanner
  - Microphone

- **Storage Unit:** The storage unit preserves data, instructions, and results for short-term and long-term use. It's divided into two main categories:

  - **Primary Storage (Main Memory):** This fast, but relatively expensive memory temporarily holds the currently running programs, input data, and intermediate calculations. Since primary storage is volatile, data is lost when the computer powers down. RAM (Random Access Memory) is the most common type of primary storage.

  - **Secondary Storage (Auxiliary Memory):**

    This type of storage acts as a permanent repository for programs, data, and the operating system. It's slower than primary storage but offers larger capacity at a lower cost. Examples include:

    - Hard Disk Drives (HDD)
    - Solid-State Drives (SSD)
    - Optical Disks (CDs, DVDs)

- **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The CPU is the "brain" of the computer responsible for controlling and executing instructions. It contains two primary parts:

  - **Control Unit (CU):** The orchestrator of the CPU. It fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and generates signals to coordinate the activities of the other components within the system.
  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** The heart of calculations. The ALU performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, etc.).

- **Output Unit:** The output unit presents the results of processing to the user in a human-readable form. Examples include:

  - Monitor (display)
  - Printer
  - Speakers

**How These Components Work Together**

1. **Input:** A user enters data or instructions through an input device like a keyboard or mouse.
2. **Storage:** Data and instructions are temporarily stored in the main memory (RAM) for quick access by the CPU.
3. **Processing:**
   - The Control Unit fetches an instruction from memory and decodes it.
   - The ALU executes the instruction, potentially involving calculations or logical comparisons.
   - Results might be stored back into memory (RAM or secondary storage).
4. **Output:** The processed results are presented to the user through an output device, such as a monitor or printer.

## Basic Components of a Microprocessor

**CPU (Central Processing Unit)**

- **The Brain:** The CPU is the heart of a microprocessor, responsible for interpreting and executing instructions. Think of it as the decision-maker and coordinator of the entire system.
- Key Components:
  - **Control Unit (CU):** The manager that fetches instructions from memory, decodes them, and controls the flow of data and operations throughout the processor.
  - **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** The "calculator" within the CPU that performs all arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc.) and logical (AND, OR, NOT, etc.) operations.

**ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit)**

- **The Calculator:** The ALU is a core part of the CPU, dedicated to carrying out the calculations and logic comparisons that drive computations within the microprocessor.
- Operations:
  - Arithmetic: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.
  - Logical: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, comparisons, etc.

**Control Unit**

- **The Orchestrator:** The control unit is another essential part of the CPU. It directs all operations within the microprocessor.
- Responsibilities:
  - **Instruction Fetching:** Retrieves instructions from memory.
  - **Instruction Decoding:** Interprets instructions to determine what needs to be done.
  - **Control Signals:** Generates signals to coordinate the ALU, memory, and other components, ensuring everything works in sync.

**Memory Unit (RAM, ROM)**

- **Data and Code Storage:** The memory unit is where the microprocessor stores important data and instructions.
- Types:
  - **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Temporary, fast storage used for currently running programs and data. It's volatile, meaning data disappears when the power goes off.
  - **ROM (Read-Only Memory):** Permanent storage that typically holds the computer's startup instructions (BIOS) and other essential data that shouldn't change.

**Input/Output (I/O) Units**

- **Communication Bridge:** These units facilitate communication between the microprocessor and the outside world.
- Input Devices:
  - Keyboard
  - Mouse
  - Scanner
  - Microphone
  - Network interface card
- Output Devices:
  - Monitor
  - Printer
  - Speakers
  - Network interface card

**How It All Works Together**

1. **Fetch:** The Control Unit fetches an instruction from memory (RAM).
2. **Decode:** The Control Unit decodes the instruction to figure out the required operation.
3. **Execute:**
   - If it's a calculation or logical operation, the ALU gets involved.
   - Data may be moved between memory, the ALU, and internal registers (tiny, super-fast memory within the CPU).
4. **Store:** Results might be written back to memory or sent to an output device.

## Instruction Formats & Related Terms

### Instruction Format

A microprocessor instruction is a fundamental command encoded in binary that tells the microprocessor to perform a specific operation. Instructions generally have two core parts:

#### Opcode (Operation Code)

Specifies the operation the microprocessor should perform (e.g., add, subtract, move data, compare). The opcode is a unique binary pattern assigned to a particular action.

#### Operand

Data the operation acts upon. An operand could be:

- **Immediate Value:** Data directly included in the instruction itself.
- **Register:** A small, fast memory location inside the processor.
- **Memory Address:** A location in the main memory.

#### Example

Consider a simple 'ADD' instruction in a hypothetical microprocessor:

```
ADD  R1,  #5
```

- **Opcode:** 'ADD' tells the processor to perform an addition operation.
- **Operands**:
  - 'R1' is a register, indicating one value for the addition is stored in register R1.
  - '#5' is an immediate value, specifying the second value for the addition.

### Instruction Cycle

The instruction cycle is the complete sequence of steps a microprocessor takes to process a single instruction. It involves:

1. **Fetch:** The Control Unit retrieves the instruction's opcode from memory.

2. **Decode:** The Control Unit decodes the opcode to understand the required operation.

3. **Execute**:

   The instruction is carried out. This may involve:

   - Reading data from memory or registers.
   - Performing calculations or logical operations in the ALU.
   - Writing results back to memory or registers.

### Machine Cycle

A machine cycle represents a single, indivisible action performed by the microprocessor necessary to carry out part of an instruction's operation. Some examples of machine cycles include:

- **Memory Read:** Fetching data from memory.
- **Memory Write:** Storing data into memory.
- **I/O Read:** Reading data from an input device.
- **I/O Write:** Sending data to an output device.

An instruction cycle often comprises multiple machine cycles.

### T-State (Clock Cycle)

A T-state is the fundamental unit of time in a microprocessor, measured by a single period of the processor's internal clock. Each machine cycle typically takes one or more T-states. Faster clocks mean more T-states per second, facilitating faster processing.

**Relationship**

- **Instructions** are built from opcodes and operands.
- An **instruction cycle** consists of the steps to execute one complete instruction.
- A **machine cycle** is a smaller unit of action within an instruction cycle.
- **T-States** are the fundamental timing unit, with a machine cycle usually encompassing multiple T-states.

Instructions in the 8085 microprocessor can be 1, 2, or 3 bytes long. The structure varies depending on the specific instruction and the addressing modes used.

| Code Size        | Simpler instructions may require longer sequences to achieve the same task, increasing program size.             | Complex instructions can increase complexity and potential for errors, impacting performance.                      |
| Compiler         | Burden placed on the compiler to generate efficient code.                                                        | Can hide hardware complexity, simplifying software development.                                                    |
