## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Derive the equation of overall gain with negative feedback in amplifier and give application of negative feedback.**

**Answer**:

**Derivation of overall gain with negative feedback:**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    I[Input] --> S[Summing\nPoint]
    S --> A[Amplifier\nA]
    A --> O[Output]
    O --> F[Feedback\nNetwork β]
    F --> S
```

- For an amplifier with gain A and feedback factor β:
  - Input signal = Vin
  - Feedback signal = βVout
  - Actual input to amplifier = Vin - βVout
  - Output = A(Vin - βVout)
  - Therefore, Vout = A(Vin - βVout)
  - Vout + AβVout = AVin
  - Vout(1 + Aβ) = AVin
  - **Overall gain = Vout/Vin = A/(1 + Aβ)**

**Applications of negative feedback:**

- Operational amplifiers
- Voltage regulators
- Audio amplifiers
- Instrumentation amplifiers

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

| **Class A** | 360° | Amplifier conducts for entire input cycle. Output signal is exact replica of input but amplified. Linear but inefficient (25-30%). |
| **Class B** | 180° | Two transistors each conduct for half cycle. One handles positive half, other handles negative half. More efficient (70-80%) but has crossover distortion. |
| **Class AB** | 180°-360° | Compromise between Class A and B. Slight bias to reduce crossover distortion. Good efficiency (50-70%) with acceptable distortion. |
| **Class C** | <180° | Conducts for less than half cycle. Very efficient (>80%) but highly distorted. Used mainly in RF tuned amplifiers. |

```

**Efficiency Calculation:**

1. **DC power input calculation:**
   - Each transistor conducts for half cycle
   - Average DC current: Idc = Imax/π
   - DC power input: Pdc = Vcc × Idc = Vcc × Imax/π

2. **AC power output calculation:**
   - RMS value of current: Irms = Imax/2
   - AC power output: Pac = (Irms)² × RL = (Imax/2)² × RL
   - For maximum power: Imax × RL = Vcc
   - Therefore: Pac = (Vcc)²/(2π × RL)

3. **Efficiency calculation:**
   - η = (Pac/Pdc) × 100%
   - η = [(Vcc)²/(2π × RL)] ÷ [Vcc × Imax/π] × 100%
   - η = [(Vcc)²/(2π × RL)] ÷ [Vcc × Vcc/(π × RL)] × 100%
   - η = [(Vcc)²/(2π × RL)] × [π × RL/Vcc²] × 100%
   - η = π/4 × 100% ≈ 78.5%

**Maximum theoretical efficiency of Class-B push-pull amplifier is 78.5%**

**Mnemonic:** "PIPE" (Power ratio, Input DC vs output AC, Pi in formula, Efficiency maximum 78.5%)

           +----+
                |
               GND
```

**Gain Derivation:**

- Using virtual ground concept (V- ≈ 0)
- Current through Rin: Iin = Vin/Rin
- Current through Rf: If = Iin (no current into op-amp input)
- Voltage across Rf: Vout = -If × Rf = -Iin × Rf = -Vin × Rf/Rin
- Therefore, Gain = Vout/Vin = -Rf/Rin

**Non-Inverting Amplifier:**

                      |
                     GND
```

**Gain Derivation:**

- Due to negative feedback, V- ≈ V+ = Vin
- Voltage across Rin: V- = Vin
- Current through Rin: IRin = V-/Rin = Vin/Rin
- Same current flows through Rf: IRf = IRin
- Voltage across Rf: VRf = IRf × Rf = Vin × Rf/Rin
- Output voltage: Vout = V- + VRf = Vin + Vin × Rf/Rin = Vin(1 + Rf/Rin)
- Therefore, Gain = Vout/Vin = 1 + Rf/Rin

**Comparison:**

| Parameter | Inverting Amplifier | Non-Inverting Amplifier |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| **Gain formula** | -Rf/Rin | 1 + Rf/Rin |
| **Phase shift** | 180° | 0° |
| **Input impedance** | Equal to Rin | Very high (≈ infinite) |
| **Min. possible gain** | Can be <1 | Always ≥1 |

**Working:**

1. **Voltage Divider**: Creates reference voltages at 1/3 and 2/3 of Vcc
2. **Comparators**: Compare input voltages with reference voltages
3. **Flip-Flop**: Stores timing state based on comparator outputs
4. **Output Stage**: Buffers and amplifies flip-flop output
5. **Discharge Transistor**: Controlled by flip-flop to discharge timing capacitor

**Operating Modes:**

1. **Monostable**: One-shot timer triggered by input pulse
2. **Astable**: Free-running oscillator for pulse generation
3. **Bistable**: Flip-flop with set and reset functionality

**Applications:**

- Pulse generation
- Time delays
- Oscillators
- PWM controllers
- Sequential timers

**Mnemonic:** "VICTOR" (Voltage divider, Internal comparators, Control flip-flop, Timing capabilities, Output buffer, Reset function)
