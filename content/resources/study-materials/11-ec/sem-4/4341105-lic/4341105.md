## 1. RATIONALE

Analogue electronic components and circuits are building blocks for any electronic device used in industries or in daily life. It is therefore necessary for electronics engineers to understand clearly the principle and functioning of the basic analogue components and circuits. This course will enable the students to understand the basics of construction, working, and applications of various types of electronic circuits such as feedback amplifiers, oscillators, power amplifiers, operational  amplifiers,  and  timers  using  linear  ICs.  Practical  exercises  of  this  course  would enable students to maintain such circuits and in turn maintain equipment having such circuits. Understanding of these concepts will be useful to determine the various parameters required to solve various problems and applications. This course has been designed to achieve these aims.
