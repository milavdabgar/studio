## 1. RATIONALE

Analogue electronic components and circuits are building blocks for any electronic device used in industries or in daily life. It is therefore necessary for electronics engineers to understand clearly the principle and functioning of the basic analogue components and circuits. This course will enable the students to understand the basics of construction, working, and applications of various types of electronic circuits such as feedback amplifiers, oscillators, power amplifiers, operational  amplifiers,  and  timers  using  linear  ICs.  Practical  exercises  of  this  course  would enable students to maintain such circuits and in turn maintain equipment having such circuits. Understanding of these concepts will be useful to determine the various parameters required to solve various problems and applications. This course has been designed to achieve these aims.

## 2. COMPETENCY

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- Teacher guided tutorial exercises to solve problems based on all units.
- Implement all circuits on a breadboard and test the output.
- Computer based tutorial (CBT) and videos describing operation and working for all the units.
- Seminars and group discussion.
- Present seminar on any topic related to the subject.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature can  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using  different assessment methods.
- e) With  respect  to section  No.10 ,  teachers  need  to  ensure  to  create  opportunities  and provisions for co-curricular activities .
