## 1. Rationale

Analogue electronic components and circuits are building blocks for any electronic device used
in industries or in daily life. It is therefore necessary for electronics engineers to understand
clearly the principle and functioning of the basic analogue components and circuits. This course
will enable the students to understand the basics of construction, working, and applications of
various types of electronic circuits such as feedback amplifiers, oscillators, power amplifiers,
operational amplifiers, and timers using linear ICs. Practical exercises of this course would
enable students to maintain such circuits and in turn maintain equipment having such circuits.
Understanding of these concepts will be useful to determine the various parameters required
to solve various problems and applications. This course has been designed to achieve these
aims.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Maintain various types of analogue electronic components & circuits.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with
the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of the
following COs:
- Study various parameters of negative feedback amplifiers.
- Measure output of different types of Oscillators.
- Describe different types of Power amplifier.
- Test different types of circuits using operational amplifier IC 741.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes
in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about
5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s)
portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- Teacher guided tutorial exercises to solve problems based on all units.
- Implement all circuits on a breadboard and test the output.
- Computer based tutorial (CBT) and videos describing operation and working for all the
- Seminars and group discussion.
- Present seminar on any topic related to the subject.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by
teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature
can be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
