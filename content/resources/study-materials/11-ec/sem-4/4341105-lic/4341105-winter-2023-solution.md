## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**What is negative feedback? List out advantages and disadvantages of negative feedback.**

**Answer**:
Negative feedback is feeding a portion of output signal back to the input with 180° phase shift to reduce the input signal.

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Increased stability | Reduced gain |
| Reduced distortion | Complex circuit design |
| Increased bandwidth | More components required |
| Reduced noise | Higher power consumption |

**Mnemonic:** "SIRS" - Stability Improved, Reduced distortion, Sensitivity decreased

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Describe the effect of negative feedback on frequency response and distortion of an amplifier.**

**Answer**:
Negative feedback improves both frequency response and reduces distortion in amplifiers.

    Vi -->|  Σ  |----->|       |----> Vo (Output)
          +-----+      |   A   |
             ^         |       |

```

- **AC power output**: P₀ = Vrms × Irms = (Vm/√2) × (Im/√2) = Vm × Im/2
- **DC power input**: PDC = VCC × IDC = VCC × (2×Im/π)
- **Efficiency**: η = P₀/PDC = (Vm×Im/2)/(VCC×2×Im/π) = (Vm×π)/(4×VCC)
