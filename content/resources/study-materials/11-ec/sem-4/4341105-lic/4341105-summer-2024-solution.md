## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**State and explain the difference between positive and negative feedback with diagram.**

**Answer**:

| Parameter | Negative Feedback | Positive Feedback |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Signal | Output signal is fed back to input with opposite phase | Output signal is fed back to input with same phase |
| Gain | Decreases | Increases |
| Stability | Improves | Reduces |
| Applications | Amplifiers | Oscillators |

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Amplifier]
    B --> C[Output]
    C --> D{Feedback Network}
    
    %% Negative Feedback
    subgraph Negative Feedback
    D -->|180° Phase Shift| E[Subtractor]
    E --> B
    end
    
    %% Positive Feedback
    subgraph Positive Feedback
    D -->|0° Phase Shift| F[Adder]
    F --> B
    end
```

- **Phase relationship**: In negative feedback, signal is 180° out of phase while in positive feedback, signal is in phase
- **Purpose**: Negative feedback stabilizes system while positive feedback creates oscillations

**Mnemonic:** "Negative Needs Stability, Positive Produces Oscillations"

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Explain the effect of negative feedback on input impedance of the Amplifier.**

**Answer**:

| Type of Feedback | Effect on Input Impedance | Formula |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Voltage Series | Increases | Z(in-f) = Z(in)(1+Aβ) |
| Current Series | Increases | Z(in-f) = Z(in)(1+Aβ) |
| Voltage Shunt | Decreases | Z(in-f) = Z(in)/(1+Aβ) |
| Current Shunt | Decreases | Z(in-f) = Z(in)/(1+Aβ) |

**Diagram:**

```mermaid

    A[Input Signal] --> B[Input Impedance]

    D --> E[Feedback Network]
    E --> F[Summing Point]
    F --> B
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

- **Series feedback**: When feedback signal is in series with input, input impedance increases
- **Shunt feedback**: When feedback signal is in parallel with input, input impedance decreases
- **Magnitude**: Change is proportional to (1+Aβ) where A is gain and β is feedback factor

**Mnemonic:** "Series Soars, Shunt Shrinks"

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

| Reduces distortion | May cause oscillation if improperly designed |
| Reduces noise | Requires careful phase compensation |
| Improves input/output impedance | Increases power consumption |
| Reduces temperature sensitivity | Makes circuit more complex |
| Controls frequency response | May reduce signal-to-noise ratio in some cases |

| Practical Efficiency | 60-70% | Considering losses |

**Mathematical Derivation:**

For a sinusoidal input: v(t) = Vm sin(ωt)

**Step 1**: DC Input Power

- Input current per transistor: Im/π
- Total DC input power: PDC = 2VCC×Im/π

**Step 2**: AC Output Power

- RMS output voltage: Vrms = Vm/√2
- Maximum output voltage: Vm = VCC
- Output power: PAC = Vrms²/RL = Vm²/2RL

**Step 3**: Efficiency Calculation

- η = (PAC/PDC)×100%
- η = ((Vm²/2RL)/(2VCC×Im/π))×100%
- Since Vm = VCC and Im = VCC/RL
- η = (π/4)×100% = 78.5%

- **Power dissipation**: Most efficient when output voltage swing approaches VCC
- **Conduction angle**: Each transistor conducts for exactly 180°
- **Practical factors**: Biasing current, saturation voltage, and other losses reduce efficiency
- **Comparison**: Much higher than Class A (25-30%), less than Class C (>80%)

**Basic Operation:**

1. **Voltage divider**: Creates 2/3 VCC and 1/3 VCC reference points
2. **Comparator 1**: Triggers when pin 2 goes below 1/3 VCC
3. **Comparator 2**: Resets when pin 6 goes above 2/3 VCC
4. **Flip-flop**: Controls output state based on comparator inputs
5. **Discharge transistor**: Connects pin 7 to ground when output is LOW

- **Versatility**: Can be configured in multiple modes (astable, monostable, bistable)
- **Timing precision**: Determined by external RC components
- **Wide supply range**: Functions from 4.5V to 16V

**Mnemonic:** "Comparators Control Flip-flop For Timing"

## Question 5(c) OR [7 marks]

**Explain how class A, Class B, Class C and Class AB Power amplifier are classified based on their Q Point location on load line, with diagram.**

**Answer**:

| Amplifier Class | Q-Point Location | Conduction Angle | Efficiency |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| Class A | Center of load line | 360° | 25-30% |
| Class B | Cut-off point | 180° | 78.5% |
| Class AB | Slightly above cut-off | 180°-360° | 50-78.5% |
| Class C | Below cut-off | <180° | >80% |

```

**Class A Characteristics:**

- **Q-point**: Center of load line
- **Bias**: Fixed bias maintains conduction for entire cycle
- **Linearity**: Excellent linearity, minimal distortion
- **Efficiency**: Poor (25-30%)

**Class B Characteristics:**

- **Q-point**: At cutoff point
- **Bias**: Biased at cutoff, each device conducts for half-cycle
- **Distortion**: Crossover distortion at zero-crossing
- **Efficiency**: Good (78.5% theoretical)

**Class AB Characteristics:**

- **Q-point**: Slightly above cutoff
- **Bias**: Small bias current eliminates crossover distortion
- **Linearity**: Good compromise between A and B
- **Efficiency**: Moderate (50-78.5%)

**Class C Characteristics:**

- **Q-point**: Below cutoff
- **Bias**: Conducts for less than half-cycle
- **Distortion**: Severe distortion, requires tuned circuit
- **Efficiency**: Excellent (>80%)

**Mnemonic:** "Above center, Below center, Cut-off point, Down below - ABCD order for Q-point location"
