## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Explain Shanon Fano code with suitable example.**

**Answer**:

**Shannon-Fano Coding**: A technique that assigns variable-length codes to symbols based on their probabilities by recursively dividing the set of symbols into two subsets with approximately equal probabilities.

**Example**:
Consider symbols A, B, C, D with probabilities 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.1

**Shannon-Fano Procedure**:

1. Sort symbols by probability: A(0.4), B(0.3), C(0.2), D(0.1)
2. Divide into groups with nearly equal probability:
   - Group 1: A(0.4) - assigned '0'
   - Group 2: B(0.3), C(0.2), D(0.1) = 0.6 - assigned '1'
3. Recursively divide Group 2:
   - Group 2.1: B(0.3) - assigned '10'
   - Group 2.2: C(0.2), D(0.1) = 0.3 - assigned '11'
4. Divide Group 2.2:
   - C(0.2) - assigned '110'
   - D(0.1) - assigned '111'

| Symbol | Probability | Shannon-Fano Code |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| A | 0.4 | 0 |
| B | 0.3 | 10 |
| C | 0.2 | 110 |
| D | 0.1 | 111 |

**Average Code Length** = 0.4×1 + 0.3×2 + 0.2×3 + 0.1×3 = 1.9 bits/symbol
