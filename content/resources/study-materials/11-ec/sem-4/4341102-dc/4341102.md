Note: This  specification  table  shall  be  treated  as  only  general  guideline  for  students  and teachers. The actual distribution of marks in the question paper may vary from above table

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidence for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- Teacher guided tutorial exercises to solve problems based on all units.
- Implement all circuits on breadboard and verify the design.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature can be given to the students for self-learning , but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to  5).  However, in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters ,  the  number  of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Design sample and hold circuit.
- b) Explore ASK Modulator and Demodulator circuit.
- c) Explore FSK Modulator and Demodulator circuit.
- d) Explore circuit of PSK Modulator and Demodulator
- e) Explore circuit of Modulator and Demodulator (modem)

- f) Mini project should be prepared based on - Using Arduino or Raspberry Ri boards and its software platforms.
- g) Prepare  a  brief  report  to  illustrate  digital  communication  based  applications  being used  in  various  sectors  (Banking,  Medicine,  Defense,  E-  commerce,  Education, Environment, Industries etc.)
- h) Industrial visit  to  telephone  exchange and  mobile  switching center  /  EPABX manufacturing unit.
