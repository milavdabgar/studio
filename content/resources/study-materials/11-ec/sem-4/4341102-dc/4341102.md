## 1. Rationale

Digital communication plays vital role in the field of electronic communication systems which
includes wired and wireless communications viz. telecommunication, radio, mobile and
satellite communication systems. This course will enable Electronics and communication
engineering diploma engineers to maintain digital communication and networking equipment
and circuits used in the practical field. This course also lay the foundation to understand the
advanced communication courses in the subsequent semesters.

## 2. Competency

 above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this course
 competency.

- Prepare the list of equipment required in laboratory session.
- Complete experiment within given time.
- Adhere to laboratory guidelines.

 The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
 level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
 should gradually increase as planned below:

‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year.
     ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
     iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised
Bloom’s taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If
required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidence for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- Teacher guided tutorial exercises to solve problems based on all units.
- Implement all circuits on breadboard and verify the design.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:

- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature can be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are
group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to
submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Design sample and hold circuit.
- Explore ASK Modulator and Demodulator circuit.
- Explore FSK Modulator and Demodulator circuit.
- Explore circuit of PSK Modulator and Demodulator
- Explore circuit of Modulator and Demodulator (modem)

- Mini project should be prepared based on - Using Arduino or Raspberry Ri boards and its
            software platforms.
- Prepare a brief report to illustrate digital communication based applications being
         used in various sectors (Banking, Medicine, Defense, E- commerce, Education,
         Environment, Industries etc.)
- Industrial visit to telephone exchange and mobile switching center / EPABX
         manufacturing unit.
