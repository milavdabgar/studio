## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

1. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics
2. Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects
3. Some of the topics/sub-topics is relatively simple and very easy to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods

5. Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine
6. Arrange visit to relevant industry
7. Show video lectures on Microcontroller Applications with help of internet
8. Programming practices on simulators (free downloadable)

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based.  However,  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters,  it  should  be  preferably  be individually undertaken  to  build  up  the  skill  and  confidence  in  every  student  to  become

problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.
