 above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
 competency.
-       Work as a leader/a team member.
-       Follow ethical practices.
 The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
 level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
 should gradually increase as planned below:
      ‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
 ii.      ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
 iii.     ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular
activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of
each activity.
- Prepare journals based on practical performed in laboratory.
ii) Prepare chart to represent the block diagram of different interfacing chips. Develop a
practical application using ATMega32 Microcontroller
iv) Prepare General purpose board with all ports available as connector                    v)
Prepare/Download a dynamic animation to illustrate the following
- Timer operation               • Two Wire serial Interface (I2C)
- MAX 7221 Interfacing.        • DC Motor Interfacing

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- Some of the topics/sub-topics is relatively simple and very easy to the students for self-
learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.09, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine.
- Arrange visit to relevant industry
- Show video lectures on Microcontroller Applications with help of internet.
- Programming practices on simulators (free downloadable).

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become

Embedded System & Microcontroller Application                                                  Course Code: 4351102

problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

```
which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be
less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to
submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
        A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.

- ICRO PROJECT 1: Prepare following Items.
```

1. Prepare Specification Table for AVR microcontroller family.
2. Design a chart of ATMega32 Architecture.

- IICRO PROJECT 2: Prepare following Designs.
1. Design minimum hardware system for ATMega32 circuit.
2. Develop ATMega32 based application board/circuit on PCB.

- ICRO PROJECT 3: Design Application oriented basic Project using ATMega32.
1. Design and Implement LED flasher circuit.
2. Design and Implement circuit for relay-based operation using switch.
3. Design and Implement Room Temperature Monitor/Controller System.
4. Design and Implement Water Level Indicator/controller circuit.
