  "rationale": "The mobile communication has seen an exponential growth over the years. Not only that, but there are different technologies, such as GSM and CDMA with their variations and the 5th generation mobile technology is the latest one. This scenario demands the need for more skilled technicians for operation, maintenance and servicing of mobile cellular systems. Also wireless connectivity provides mobility, flexibility to the users, so it is necessary to understand different wireless technologies. This course gives the opportunity to the students to learn the fundamentals of these technologies, which they will find in the workplace. Hence this course is designed to maintain various types of mobile communication systems and wireless technologies.",
