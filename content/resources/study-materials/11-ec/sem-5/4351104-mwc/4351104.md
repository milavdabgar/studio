Semester-V

Course Title: Mobile & Wireless Communication
- Course Code: 4351104)

Diploma program in which this course is offered                 Semester in which offered
Electronics and Communication Engineering                            5th semester

## 1. Rationale

The mobile communication has seen an exponential growth over the years. Not only that, but there
are different technologies, such as GSM and CDMA with their variations and the 5th generation
mobile technology is the latest one. This scenario demands the need for more skilled technicians for
operation, maintenance and servicing of mobile cellular systems. Also wireless connectivity provides
mobility, flexibility to the users, so it is necessary to understand different wireless technologies. This
course gives the opportunity to the students to learn the fundamentals of these technologies, which
they will find in the workplace. Hence this course is designed to maintain various types of mobile
communication systems and wireless technologies.

## 2. Competency

The course content should be taught and with the aim to develop different types of skills, So that
students are able to acquire following competency:
Maintain mobile communication systems and establish wireless network.

3. COURSEOUTCOMES(COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with the
identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of the following COs:
- Identify different standards of mobile communication systems.
ii. Maintain Global System for Mobile (GSM) systems.
iii. Troubleshoot GSM mobile handsets.
iv. Test the functionality of spread spectrum based cellular systems.
- Test the functionality of various advanced wireless standards and wireless technologies.

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow safety practices while using electrical, electronic instruments and tools.
- Follow ethical practices
The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1styear.
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 10. Suggestedstudentactivities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
- Industrial visit to BTS site or MSC.
- Workshop on mobile repair by service technician of any mobile repairing centre.
- To explore websites to understand repairing of various mobile handsets.
- To visit sites, where wireless technology based applications are used/designed.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONA LSTRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various
topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in under taking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No.4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for reading datasheets.
- Motivate student to install and use different wireless technologies.

- 2. SUGGESTEDMICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more Cos

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-

- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Seminar on recent and upcoming trends in Wireless technology.
- Poster preparation for recent advances in wireless networks.
- Seminar on analysis of recent mobile operating system technologies.
- Poster preparation for recent mobile phone architectures.
