Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to  teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities  which  can  be  undertaken  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the  various outcomes in this course. Students should perform following activities in group (or individual) and prepare  reports  of  about  5  pages  for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record  physical evidence for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Undertake micro-projects in teams .
- b) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- c) Participate in online coding challenges and hackathons to improve programming skills in Python.
- d) Make a list of the Python-based applications or software.
- e) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx, Coursera, Udemy, Sololearn etc. to further enhance their learning.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These  are  sample  strategies,  which  the  teacher  can  use  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) Code  reviews:  Conduct  code  reviews  to  provide  feedback  to  students  on  their  coding skills.  This  will  help  them  to  identify  areas  where  they  need  to  improve  and  also  learn best practices from their peers.
- e) Online  resources:  Provide  students  with  access  to  online  resources,  such  as  tutorials, videos,  and  forums,  that  will  help  them  to  deepen  their  understanding  of  Python concepts and also provide them with additional practice opportunities.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her  in  the  beginning  of  the  semester.  In  the  first  four  semesters,  the  micro-projects  are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work  diary  consisting  of  individual  contributions  in  the  project  work  and  give  a  seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 12-14 (fourteen  to  sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The  students  ought  to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Develop a program to simulate a simple game using control structures, functions, and OOP concepts.
- b) Create a program to manage a student database using dictionaries, lists, and functions.
- c) Develop a program to calculate statistics on a dataset using modules and functions.
- d) Implement a simple calculator using OOP concepts, including inheritance and polymorphism.
- e) Build a program to analyze text data using string operations, sets, and dictionaries.
- f) Create a program to perform image processing using modules and functions.
- g) Develop a program to simulate a simple banking system using OOP concepts, including encapsulation and inheritance.
- h) Implement a program to manage a simple inventory system using lists and dictionaries.
- i) Create a program to generate and manage passwords using string operations and modules.
- j) Build a program to implement various sorting algorithms using functions and OOP concepts.
- k) Weather Data Visualization: Develop a tool that reads weather data from a file, such as a CSV, and creates graphical representations of the data using libraries such as Matplotlib. (for data visit <https://open-meteo.com/>, <https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api> etc)
  1. Weather Data Analytics: Build a program that analyzes large sets of weather data, such as historical temperature, wind speed, and precipitation data, and identifies patterns and trends. (for data visit <https://open-meteo.com/>, <https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api> etc)

- l) Air Quality Monitoring: Develop a tool that retrieves air quality data from APIs, stores it in a database, and displays the data using charts and graphs. (for data visit <https://data.gov.in/catalog/historical-daily-ambient-air-quality-data> etc)
