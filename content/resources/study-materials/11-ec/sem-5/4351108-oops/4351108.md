## 1. RATIONALE

A course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) and Python Programming can be beneficial for students as it covers basic and advanced programming concepts and provides a foundation for software development. The course covers a variety of topics, including basic programming concepts, advanced OOPS concepts. Additionally, the course can provide best practices and tips for writing Python code, debugging, and testing code, and avoiding common mistakes. Overall, the course can equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a variety of programming roles.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

**Competency:** Develop program using Object-Oriented Python Programming (OOPS) to solve given problem.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with the  identified  competency  are  to  be  developed  in  the  student  for  the  achievement  of  the following COs:

- Demonstrate  proficiency  in  Python  programming  fundamentals,  including  data types, control structures, loops, input-output functions.
- Develop python programs by applying data structures - list, dictionary, tuple, set and strings concepts.
- Design Python functions and modules.
- Apply object-oriented programming principles using Python.

## Note

- i. More Practical  Exercises can  be  designed  and  offered  by  the  respective  course  teacher  to develop  the  industry  relevant  skills/outcomes  to  match  the  COs.  The  above  table  is  only  a suggestive list .
- ii. The following are some sample 'Process' and 'Product' related skills (more may  be added/deleted depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical  Exercises of this course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

## 6. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the abovementioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this  course competency.

- a. Work as a leader/a team member (while doing a micro-project).
- b. Follow safety practices.
- c. Maintain tools and equipments.
- d. Adhere to ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If required, more such  UOs  could  be  included  by  the  course  teacher  to  focus  on  attainment  of  COs  and competency.

Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to  teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities  which  can  be  undertaken  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the  various outcomes in this course. Students should perform following activities in group (or individual) and prepare  reports  of  about  5  pages  for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record  physical evidence for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Undertake micro-projects in teams .
- b) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- c) Participate in online coding challenges and hackathons to improve programming skills in Python.
- d) Make a list of the Python-based applications or software.
- e) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx, Coursera, Udemy, Sololearn etc. to further enhance their learning.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These  are  sample  strategies,  which  the  teacher  can  use  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) Code  reviews:  Conduct  code  reviews  to  provide  feedback  to  students  on  their  coding skills.  This  will  help  them  to  identify  areas  where  they  need  to  improve  and  also  learn best practices from their peers.
- e) Online  resources:  Provide  students  with  access  to  online  resources,  such  as  tutorials, videos,  and  forums,  that  will  help  them  to  deepen  their  understanding  of  Python concepts and also provide them with additional practice opportunities.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her  in  the  beginning  of  the  semester.  In  the  first  four  semesters,  the  micro-projects  are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work  diary  consisting  of  individual  contributions  in  the  project  work  and  give  a  seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 12-14 (fourteen  to  sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The  students  ought  to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Develop a program to simulate a simple game using control structures, functions, and OOP concepts.
- b) Create a program to manage a student database using dictionaries, lists, and functions.
- c) Develop a program to calculate statistics on a dataset using modules and functions.
- d) Implement a simple calculator using OOP concepts, including inheritance and polymorphism.
- e) Build a program to analyze text data using string operations, sets, and dictionaries.
- f) Create a program to perform image processing using modules and functions.
- g) Develop a program to simulate a simple banking system using OOP concepts, including encapsulation and inheritance.
- h) Implement a program to manage a simple inventory system using lists and dictionaries.
- i) Create a program to generate and manage passwords using string operations and modules.
- j) Build a program to implement various sorting algorithms using functions and OOP concepts.
- k) Weather Data Visualization: Develop a tool that reads weather data from a file, such as a CSV, and creates graphical representations of the data using libraries such as Matplotlib. (for data visit <https://open-meteo.com/>, <https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api> etc)

1. Weather Data Analytics: Build a program that analyzes large sets of weather data, such as historical temperature, wind speed, and precipitation data, and identifies patterns and trends. (for data visit <https://open-meteo.com/>, <https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api> etc)

- l) Air Quality Monitoring: Develop a tool that retrieves air quality data from APIs, stores it in a database, and displays the data using charts and graphs. (for data visit <https://data.gov.in/catalog/historical-daily-ambient-air-quality-data> etc)
