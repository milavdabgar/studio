Diploma programmer in which this course is offered              Semester in which offered
Electronics & Communication Engineering                          5th Semester

## 1. Rationale

A course on Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) and Python Programming can be beneficial
for students as it covers basic and advanced programming concepts and provides a foundation
for software development. The course cover a variety of topics, including basic programming
concepts, advanced OOPS concepts. Additionally, the course can provide best practices and tips
for writing Python code, debugging, and testing code, and avoiding common mistakes. Overall,
the course can equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a variety of
programming roles.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Develop program using Object-Oriented Python Programming (OOPS) to solve given
problem.
## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with
the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of the
following COs:
- Demonstrate proficiency in Python programming fundamentals, including data
types, control structures, loops, input-output functions.
- Develop python programs by applying data structures – list, dictionary, tuple, set and
strings concepts.
- Design Python functions and modules.
- Apply object-oriented programming principles using Python.

mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this course
competency.

-   Work as a leader/a team member (while doing a micro-project).
-   Follow safety practices.
-   Maintain tools and equipments.
-   Adhere to ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of
achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should gradually
increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and
to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to
assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels
(of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course. Students should perform following activities in group (or individual) and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidence for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
- Undertake micro-projects in teams .
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Participate in online coding challenges and hackathons to improve programming skills in
Python.
- Make a list of the Python-based applications or software.
- Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx,
Coursera, Udemy, Sololearn etc. to further enhance their learning.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- Code reviews: Conduct code reviews to provide feedback to students on their coding
skills. This will help them to identify areas where they need to improve and also learn
best practices from their peers.
- Online resources: Provide students with access to online resources, such as tutorials,
videos, and forums, that will help them to deepen their understanding of Python
concepts and also provide them with additional practice opportunities.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are
group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students
in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which
## Practical Outcomes

```
are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated
work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 12-14
(fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to
submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs.
Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Develop a program to simulate a simple game using control structures, functions, and
- OP concepts.
- Create a program to manage a student database using dictionaries, lists, and functions.
- Develop a program to calculate statistics on a dataset using modules and functions.
- Implement a simple calculator using OOP concepts, including inheritance and
       polymorphism.
- Build a program to analyze text data using string operations, sets, and dictionaries.
- Create a program to perform image processing using modules and functions.
- Develop a program to simulate a simple banking system using OOP concepts, including
       encapsulation and inheritance.
- Implement a program to manage a simple inventory system using lists and dictionaries.
- Create a program to generate and manage passwords using string operations and
       modules.
- Build a program to implement various sorting algorithms using functions and OOP
       concepts.
- Weather Data Visualization: Develop a tool that reads weather data from a file, such as a
- SV, and creates graphical representations of the data using libraries such as Matplotlib.
       (for data visit https://open-meteo.com/, https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api
       etc)
       Weather Data Analytics: Build a program that analyzes large sets of weather data, such
       as historical temperature, wind speed, and precipitation data, and identifies patterns
       and trends.
- Air Quality Monitoring: Develop a tool that retrieves air quality data from APIs, stores it
       in a database, and displays the data using charts and graphs.
