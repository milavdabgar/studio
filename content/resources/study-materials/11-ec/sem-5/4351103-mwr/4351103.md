## 8. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned  COs  and  PRO  s.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this course competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow safety practices while using electrical, electronics, pneumatic instruments and tools.

The  ADOs  are  best  developed  through  the  laboratory/field  based  exercises.  Moreover,  the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year

- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

The  major  underpinning  theory  is  given  below  based  on  the  higher  level  UOs  of Revised Bloom's  taxonomy that  are  formulated  for  development  of  the  COs  and  competency.  If required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

- ïƒ¼ Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested student-related co-curricular activities  which  can  be  undertaken  to  accelerate  the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their  (student's)  portfolio  which  may  be useful for their placement interviews:
- ï‚· Teacher guided tutorial exercises to solve problems based on all units.
- ï‚· Implement all circuits on breadboard and verify the design.
- ïƒ¼ Following is the list of proposed student activities such as:
- i. Prepare chart showing various microwave components.
- ii. Prepare/Download a dynamic animation to illustrate the following:
- a. Microwave tubes.
- b. EM waves propagation.
- iii.  Visit  a  place  where  waveguides  are  used  for  microwave  communication.  ((Such  as airport, earth station, Telephone exchange, Microwave link repeater, TV broadcast).

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  can  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10 ,  teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based  (group  of  3  to  5).  However, in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters ,  the  number  of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during  the  course.  The  students  ought  to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented CO s.

A list of micro-projects has to match the competency and the COs. Micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
