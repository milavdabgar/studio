## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  can  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10 ,  teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based  (group  of  3  to  5).  However, in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters ,  the  number  of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during  the  course.  The  students  ought  to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented CO s.

A list of micro-projects has to match the competency and the COs. Micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
