## 8. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
above-mentioned COs and PRO s. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow safety practices while using electrical, electronics, pneumatic instruments and
tools.
The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
   ‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

- Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested
student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the
attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following
activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should
also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be
useful for their placement interviews:

- Teacher guided tutorial exercises to solve problems based on all units.
- Implement all circuits on breadboard and verify the design.
- Following is the list of proposed student activities such as:
- Prepare chart showing various microwave components.
ii. Prepare/Download a dynamic animation to illustrate the following:
- Microwave tubes.
- EM waves propagation.
iii. Visit a place where waveguides are used for microwave communication. ((Such as
airport, earth station, Telephone exchange, Microwave link repeater, TV broadcast).

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature can be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are
group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

## Practical Outcomes

```
   which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
   dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
   presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-16
   (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to
   submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented CO s.
   A list of micro-projects has to match the competency and the COs. Micro-projects could be
   added by the concerned course teacher:
