**Answer**:

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Resistance** | The property of a material that opposes the flow of electric current, measured in ohms (Ω) |

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**State and Explain Ohm's Law & write limitations of it.**

**Answer**:

**Ohm's Law**: The current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across the conductor and inversely proportional to its resistance.

Mathematically: V = IR, where:

- V = Voltage (volts)
- I = Current (amperes)
- R = Resistance (ohms)

2. **Generator**: Transforms mechanical rotation to electrical energy
3. **Controller**: Regulates power output and protects from high winds
4. **Battery**: Stores excess energy (for off-grid systems)
5. **Inverter**: Converts DC to AC for consumption
6. **Grid Connection**: Feeds excess power to grid or draws when needed

**Types of Wind Turbines:**

- Horizontal Axis (HAWT): Main commercial type
- Vertical Axis (VAWT): Better for urban settings

**Wind Speed Requirements:**

- Cut-in speed: 3-5 m/s
- Rated output: 12-15 m/s
- Cut-out speed: 25 m/s (for safety)

**Mnemonic:** "WGCBIL" - Wind Generates, Controller Balances, Inverter Loads
