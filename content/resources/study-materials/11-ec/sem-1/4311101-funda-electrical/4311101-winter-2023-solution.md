```

**Step-by-step solution:**

1. R2 and R3 are in series: R23 = R2 + R3 = 3Ω + 4Ω = 7Ω
2. R23 and R4 are in parallel: 1/R234 = 1/7 + 1/1 = (1+7)/7 = 8/7
   Therefore, R234 = 7/8 = 0.875Ω
3. R1, R234, and R5 are in series: 
   Req = R1 + R234 + R5 = 5Ω + 0.875Ω + 2Ω = 7.875Ω

**Therefore, equivalent resistance = 7.875Ω**
