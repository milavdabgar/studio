**KVL Example:** V₁ + V₂ + V₃ = 0

**KCL Example:** I₁ + I₂ = I₃ + I₄

**Mnemonic:** "VCL" - Voltage around Closed Loop is zero, Currents at a point sum to zero

## Question 5(a OR) [3 marks]

**Write the difference between EMF and potential difference. Also write the difference between cell and battery.**

**Answer**:

| EMF vs. Potential Difference | Cell vs. Battery |
|------------------------------|------------------|
| **EMF**: Energy supplied by source per unit charge | **Cell**: Single unit that converts chemical energy to electrical energy |
| **Potential Difference**: Energy consumed in external circuit | **Battery**: Collection of two or more cells connected in series or parallel |
| EMF exists even in open circuit | Cell has lower voltage (typically 1.5V or 2V) |
| Potential difference exists only in closed circuit | Battery has higher voltage output |

**Diagram:**

  +---+              +---+    +---+---+---+
                     Cell     Battery (Series)
```

**Mnemonic:** "ESOP" - EMF is Source energy, Open circuit too; Potential difference is Operating energy

## Question 5(b OR) [4 marks]

**Write the relation between AC voltage and AC current for pure resistor, pure capacitor and pure inductor. Draw the vector diagram of AC voltage and AC current for pure resistor, pure capacitor and pure inductor. Also write the value of power factor for pure resistor, pure capacitor and pure inductor.**

**Answer**:

| Component | Relation | Phase Difference | Power Factor |
|-----------|----------|------------------|--------------|
| **Pure Resistor** | V = IR | In phase (0°) | 1 |
| **Pure Capacitor** | I = C(dV/dt) | Current leads voltage by 90° | 0 (leading) |
| **Pure Inductor** | V = L(dI/dt) | Current lags voltage by 90° | 0 (lagging) |

**Mnemonic:** "RCI" - Resistor Current In phase, Capacitor current leads, Inductor current lags

## Question 5(c OR) [7 marks]

**Define temperature coefficient of material and write its unit. Explain the effect of temperature on resistance of conductor with the help of temperature coefficient of conductor.**

**Answer**:

**Temperature Coefficient:** The fractional change in resistance per degree change in temperature.

**Unit:** per degree Celsius (°C⁻¹) or per Kelvin (K⁻¹)

**Effect of Temperature on Resistance:**

**Equation:** R₂ = R₁[1 + α(T₂ - T₁)]

Where:

- R₁ = Resistance at temperature T₁
- R₂ = Resistance at temperature T₂
- α = Temperature coefficient
- T₁, T₂ = Initial and final temperatures

**For Conductors (Metals):**

- Resistance increases with temperature (positive α)
- Resistance decreases when temperature decreases

**For Semiconductors:**

- Resistance decreases with temperature (negative α)

**Table:**

| Material | Temperature Coefficient (α) per °C | Behavior |
|----------|-----------------------------------|----------|
| Copper | 0.0043 | Resistance increases with temperature |
| Aluminum | 0.0039 | Resistance increases with temperature |
| Nichrome | 0.0004 | Small change with temperature |
| Silicon | -0.07 | Resistance decreases with temperature |
