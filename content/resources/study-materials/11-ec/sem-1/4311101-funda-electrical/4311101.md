can be applied for the understanding of further courses associated with their discipline
areas.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Use principles of electrical engineering in solving branch specific engineering
problems.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow safety practices while using electrical equipment.
- Realize importance of green energy.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare specification of resistor/inductor/capacitor.
- Calculate total installed electrical load of any premises.
- Give seminar on innovation in renewable energy sources.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.

Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering                                                    Course Code:4311101

- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability.
- Guide students for using data manuals.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

             A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the
competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course
teacher:
- Demonstration kit: Prepare demonstration kit for various electrical laws that has
       been part of the course.
- Components: Prepare a chart for commonly used resistors, inductors and capacitors used in
         different domestic appliances (name of appliances with type and ratings)
- LED tube light : Build and test the LED lamp circuit for its proper working.
- Power Factor Improvement: Visit a nearby sub-station and observe the use of power
         capacitors for power factor improvement and prepare a report.
- Solar/Wind power generation in India: Prepare a report on current installed capacity
         of RES with emphasis on solar and wind including the growth in last 10 years (From
         government websites)
- Energy Consumption and safety: Compile a report regarding energy consumption of
         a house.
