## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A  suggestive  list  of  micro-projects  is  given  here.  This  has  to  match  the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned  course teacher:

- a) Demonstration  kit: Prepare  demonstration  kit  for  various  electrical  laws  that  has been part of the course.
- b) Components: Prepare a chart for commonly used resistors, inductors and capacitors used in different domestic appliances  (name of appliances with type and ratings)
- c) LED tube light : Build and test the LED lamp circuit for its proper working.
- d) Power    Factor  Improvement: Visit  a  nearby  sub-station  and  observe  the  use  of    power capacitors for power factor improvement and prepare a report.
- e) Solar/Wind power generation in India: Prepare a report on current installed capacity of RES with emphasis on solar and wind including the growth in last 10 years (From government websites)
- f) Energy Consumption and safety: Compile a report  regarding energy consumption of a house.
