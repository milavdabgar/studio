**Relation Between α and β**

| Parameter | Definition | Formula |
|-----------|------------|---------|

| **β (Beta)** | • Common Emitter (CE) current gain<br>• Ratio of collector current to base current | β = I<sub>C</sub>/I<sub>B</sub> |

**Derivation Steps:**

1. We know that emitter current is the sum of base and collector currents:

5. Substituting into beta definition:
   β = I<sub>C</sub>/(I<sub>E</sub> - I<sub>C</sub>)

6. Using alpha definition, I<sub>C</sub> = α × I<sub>E</sub>:
   β = (α × I<sub>E</sub>)/(I<sub>E</sub> - α × I<sub>E</sub>)

7. Simplifying:
   β = α/(1 - α)

8. Conversely, we can also express α in terms of β:
   α = β/(β + 1)

**Relationship Table:**

| α (Alpha) | β (Beta) |
|-----------|----------|
| 0.9 | 9 |
| 0.95 | 19 |
| 0.98 | 49 |
| 0.99 | 99 |
| 0.995 | 199 |

**Mnemonic:** "ABR" - Alpha and Beta are Related by α = β/(β+1) or β = α/(1-α)

**Cutoff Operation (OFF State):**

- Input voltage is below 0.7V (typically 0V)
- Base-emitter junction is not forward biased
- No base current flows (I<sub>B</sub> ≈ 0)
- No collector current flows (I<sub>C</sub> ≈ 0)
- Collector-emitter voltage is approximately V<sub>CC</sub>
- Transistor acts as an open switch

**Saturation Operation (ON State):**

- Input voltage is above 0.7V
- Base-emitter junction is forward biased
- Sufficient base current flows (I<sub>B</sub> > I<sub>C</sub>/β)
- Collector current reaches maximum (I<sub>C(sat)</sub>)
- Collector-emitter voltage drops to minimum (V<sub>CE(sat)</sub> ≈ 0.2V)
- Transistor acts as a closed switch

**Key Design Considerations:**

- Base resistor (R<sub>B</sub>) limits base current
- Collector resistor (R<sub>C</sub>) limits collector current
- Saturation requires I<sub>B</sub> > I<sub>C</sub>/β for reliable switching
- Fast switching requires consideration of charge storage effects

**Mnemonic:** "COSVL" - Cutoff means Off State with Vce Large, saturation means low Vce
