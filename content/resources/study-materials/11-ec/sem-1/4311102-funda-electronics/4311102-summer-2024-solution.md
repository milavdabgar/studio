**Working:**

- When input is HIGH: Transistor saturates, acts like closed switch
- When input is LOW: Transistor cuts off, acts like open switch

**Mnemonic:** "No Base No Current, Apply Base Connect Circuit" (NBNC-ABC)

## Question 5(d) [4 marks]

**Derive relation between α and β for CE configuration of transistor.**

**Answer**:

In transistors, α (alpha) and β (beta) are current gain parameters.

**Definitions:**

- α = IC/IE (Common Base current gain)
- β = IC/IB (Common Emitter current gain)

**Derivation:**
Since IE = IC + IB, we can write:
α = IC/IE = IC/(IC + IB)

Dividing numerator and denominator by IB:
α = (IC/IB)/[(IC/IB) + 1] = β/(β + 1)

Therefore:
β = α/(1-α)

**Table: Relationship between α and β**

| Parameter | Formula | Typical Range |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| α from β | α = β/(β+1) | 0.9 to 0.99 |
| β from α | β = α/(1-α) | 50 to 300 |
