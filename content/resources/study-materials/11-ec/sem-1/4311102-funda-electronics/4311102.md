## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three .

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 1416 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Diode: Build  a  circuit  on  general  purpose  PCB  or  breadboard  to  obtain  +12V unregulated DC power supply using full wave bridge rectifier and filter (Duration: 810 hours)
- b) Photodiode :  Build  a  interruption  detector  circuit  to  blink  an  LED  using  LDR,  and prepare a mini project report. ((Duration: 6-8 hours)
- c) Transistor  Amplifier :  a common  emitter  amplifier  using  transistor  and  prepare  a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- d) Transistor  Application: Build  a  transistorized  water  level  indicator  and  prepare  a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8  hours)
- e) Special  Purpose  Diodes: Build  basic  applications  using  any  one  or  combination  of special purpose diodes , and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- f) Electronic  Waste : Prepare  a report of strategies regarding  handling of electronic waste with figures, tables and comparative charts.
