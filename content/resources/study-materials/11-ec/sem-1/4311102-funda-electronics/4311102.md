Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions  to  assess  the  attainment  of  the  UOs.  The  actual  distribution  of  marks  at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare  a  table  and  interpret  the  technical  specification  of  various  diodes  and transistors using data sheet.
- b) Prepare specifications of some electronic components.
- c) Collect information and seminar on any relevant topic related with the course.
- d) Undertake a market survey of different semiconductor components.
- e) Prepare  a  survey  report  different  electronic  waste  management  adopted  by  the local electronics industry.
- f) Undertake a survey of CPCB/GPCB  authorized  E-Waste handling agencies.
- g) Undertake a visit to e-waste handling plant nearby and prepare a report.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive  open  online  courses  ( MOOCs )  may  be  used  to  teach  various  topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## f) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability

- g) Guide  students  for  finding  proper  active  and  passive  components  using  datasheet manuals and websites for electronic application

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three .

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 1416 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Diode: Build  a  circuit  on  general  purpose  PCB  or  breadboard  to  obtain  +12V unregulated DC power supply using full wave bridge rectifier and filter (Duration: 810 hours)
- b) Photodiode :  Build  a  interruption  detector  circuit  to  blink  an  LED  using  LDR,  and prepare a mini project report. ((Duration: 6-8 hours)
- c) Transistor  Amplifier :  a common  emitter  amplifier  using  transistor  and  prepare  a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- d) Transistor  Application: Build  a  transistorized  water  level  indicator  and  prepare  a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8  hours)
- e) Special  Purpose  Diodes: Build  basic  applications  using  any  one  or  combination  of special purpose diodes , and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- f) Electronic  Waste : Prepare  a report of strategies regarding  handling of electronic waste with figures, tables and comparative charts.
