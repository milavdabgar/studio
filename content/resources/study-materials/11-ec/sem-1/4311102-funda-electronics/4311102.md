Power Electronics                               Second

## 1. Rationale

The engineering diploma holders are required to use and maintain various types of
electronically controlled equipment. The fundamental principles of electronics are to be
applied in most of the situations to arrive at the probable solutions which is faced in the
world of work, therefore the knowledge of the functions of various basic electronic devices
and components and practical skills acquired through the laboratory experiments will help
them, when they work with electronic equipment and its sub-circuits. This course is
designed to develop the skills to use the basics electronic components and apply the
knowledge to maintain the various typesof electronic circuits.
## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Use principles of basic electronics to maintain various electronics circuits and
equipment.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of
the following COs:
- Use basic active and passive electronic components.
- Develop different types of rectifiers using PN junction diode.
- Use special purpose diodes for different applications.
- Analyze various transistor configurations.
- Dispose electronic waste safely.

above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
course competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
- Practice environmentally friendly methods and processes.
- Follow safety precautions.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
      ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
      iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised
Bloom’s taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If
required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of
- Os and competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare a table and interpret the technical specification of various diodes and
transistors using data sheet.
- Prepare specifications of some electronic components.
- Collect information and seminar on any relevant topic related with the course.
- Undertake a market survey of different semiconductor components.
- Prepare a survey report different electronic waste management adopted by the
local electronics industry.
- Undertake a survey of CPCB/GPCB authorized E-Waste handling agencies.
- Undertake a visit to e-waste handling plant nearby and prepare a report.

Fundamentals of Electronics                                                   Course Code:4311102

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability
- Guide students for finding proper active and passive components using datasheet
manuals and websites for electronic application

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

```
which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Diode: Build a circuit on general purpose PCB or breadboard to obtain +12V
        unregulated DC power supply using full wave bridge rectifier and filter (Duration: 8-
- 0 hours)
- Photodiode: Build a interruption detector circuit to blink an LED using LDR, and
        prepare a mini project report. ((Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Transistor Amplifier: a common emitter amplifier using transistor and prepare a
        mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Transistor Application: Build a transistorized water level indicator and prepare a
- Special Purpose Diodes: Build basic applications using any one or combination of
        special purpose diodes , and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Electronic Waste: Prepare a report of strategies regarding handling of
        electronic waste with figures, tables and comparative charts.
