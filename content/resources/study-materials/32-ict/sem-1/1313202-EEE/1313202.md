- Realize importance of E-waste management
The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of
achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should gradually
increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If required, more such UOs
could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

- 0. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES:

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course.
Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each
activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be
useful for their placement interviews. For micro project reports should be as per suggested format, for
other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of the report. Students should
also collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student’s)
portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare a table and interpret the technical specification of various diodes and transistors using
data sheet
- Undertake mini/micro-projects in teams/individual basis
- Collect information and give seminar on any relevant topic related with the course.
- Undertake a market survey of different semiconductor components.
- Prepare a survey report different electronic waste management adopted by the local electronics
industry.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any):

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by
teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be
given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.

- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions
for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students to find micro project using electronic components through internet.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability and Introduce E-
waste recycling technology among the students
- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS:

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her
in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group
of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not
exceed three. The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in

fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary
consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before
submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14- 16 (fourteen to sixteen) student
engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the
semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar
micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Build a circuit for +5Vdc unregulated power supply using half wave rectifier on general purpose
- CB.
- Build a circuit for +12Vdc unregulated power supply using center-tap full wave rectifier or bridge
        rectifier on general purpose PCB.
- Build a circuit using LED and rectifier which shows the working of LED as indicator on general
- Build a circuit voltage regulator using zener diode on general purpose PCB.
- Build a circuit of common emitter amplifier using transistor and prepare a mini project report.
- Electronic Waste: Prepare a report of strategies regarding handling of electronic waste with
        figures, tables and comparative charts.
