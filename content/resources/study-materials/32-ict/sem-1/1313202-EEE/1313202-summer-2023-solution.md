## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Find mesh currents in following circuit.**

**Answer**:

**Diagram/Table:**

```
    2kΩ      2kΩ
    ┌───┐    ┌───┐
    │   │    │   │
    │   │    │   │
┌───┴───┴────┴───┴───┐
│   │              │ │
│  ┌┴┐             ┌┴┐

│  └┬┘   │         └┬┘
│   │    │          │ │
└───┴────┴──────────┴─┘
```

Applying Mesh Analysis:

- Write KVL equations for two meshes
- I₁ flows clockwise in left loop
- I₂ flows clockwise in right loop

**Steps to solve:**

- **Mesh 1 equation**: 5V - 2kΩ×I₁ - 1kΩ×(I₁-I₂) = 0
- **Mesh 2 equation**: -2V + 2kΩ×I₂ + 1kΩ×(I₂-I₁) = 0

Simplifying:

- 5 - 2000I₁ - 1000I₁ + 1000I₂ = 0
- -2 + 2000I₂ + 1000I₂ - 1000I₁ = 0

- 3000I₁ - 1000I₂ = 5
- -1000I₁ + 3000I₂ = 2

Solving:
I₁ = 2 mA
I₂ = 1 mA

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**State and explain Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) with the help of diagram.**

**Answer**:

Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) states that the algebraic sum of all voltages around any closed loop in a circuit is zero.

**Diagram:**

```

**Key points:**

## Question 4(c) OR [7 marks]

**Explain Shunt capacitor filter and π-filter with circuit diagram.**

**Answer**:

**Shunt Capacitor Filter:**

**Diagram:**

```goat
      Rectifier   C
         |        |
Vin --->|M|-------+------ Vout
         |        |
         |        RL
         |        |
         +--------+------
```

**Working principle:**

- **Charging**: Capacitor charges rapidly during voltage rise in rectifier output
- **Discharging**: Capacitor discharges slowly through load during voltage fall
- **Smoothing effect**: Reduces ripple by storing energy when voltage is high
- **Time constant**: RC should be much larger than ripple period
- **Performance**: Ripple factor γ = 1/(4√3·f·R·C)

**π-Filter:**

**Diagram:**

```goat

             |        |   |
             +--------+---+
```

**Working principle:**

- **First capacitor (C1)**: Provides initial filtering like shunt capacitor
- **Choke (L)**: Blocks AC components, allows DC to pass
- **Second capacitor (C2)**: Further reduces remaining ripple
- **Combined effect**: Acts as cascade of low-pass filters

**Comparison:**

| Parameter | Shunt Capacitor Filter | π-Filter |
|-----------|------------------------|----------|
| **Components** | Single capacitor | Two capacitors and inductor |
| **Ripple reduction** | Moderate | Excellent |
| **Cost** | Low | High |
| **Size** | Small | Large |
| **Voltage regulation** | Poor | Good |
| **Suitable for** | Low current applications | High current applications |

## Question 5(a) OR [3 marks]

**Derive relationship between current gain alpha (α) and beta (β).**

**Answer**:

**Key definitions:**

- **Alpha (α)**: Common-base current gain = I_C/I_E
- **Beta (β)**: Common-emitter current gain = I_C/I_B

**Diagram:**

```goat
         I_C

    |         |
I_E >    T    > I_B
    |         |
    +---------+
```

**Current relationship in transistor:**

- I_E = I_B + I_C (Kirchhoff's Current Law)

**Derivation steps:**

1. α = I_C/I_E
2. I_E = I_B + I_C
3. α = I_C/(I_B + I_C)
4. β = I_C/I_B
5. I_C = β × I_B
6. Substituting in equation 3:
   α = (β × I_B)/(I_B + β × I_B)
   α = β/(1 + β)
7. Solving for β:
   α(1 + β) = β
   α + αβ = β
   α = β - αβ
   α = β(1 - α)
   β = α/(1 - α)

**Final relationships:**

- β = α/(1 - α)
- α = β/(1 + β)

**Typical values:**

- α is always less than 1 (typically 0.95 to 0.99)
- β typically ranges from 20 to 200
