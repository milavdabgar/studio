## Question 5(a) OR [3 marks]

**Explain methods to handle electronic waste.**

**Answer**:

**Methods to Handle Electronic Waste:**

| **Method** | **Description** |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Reduce** | Designing products with longer lifecycle and upgradability |
| **Reuse** | Refurbishing and donating electronics for secondary use |
| **Recycle** | Systematic disassembly to recover valuable materials |
| **Responsible Disposal** | Proper collection and processing by certified facilities |
| **Extended Producer Responsibility** | Manufacturers take back used products |
| **Urban Mining** | Recovering precious metals from discarded electronics |

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Derive the relationship between αdc and βdc.**

**Answer**:

**Relationship between α and β:**

**Given:**

- αdc = IC/IE (Common base current gain)
- βdc = IC/IB (Common emitter current gain)

**Derivation:**
From Kirchhoff's current law:
IE = IC + IB

Dividing both sides by IC:
IE/IC = 1 + IB/IC

Since αdc = IC/IE:
1/αdc = 1 + IB/IC

Since βdc = IC/IB:
1/αdc = 1 + 1/βdc

**Final Relations:**

- αdc = βdc/(1 + βdc)
- βdc = αdc/(1 - αdc)

**Table:**
| **α Value** | **β Value** |
|-------------|-------------|
| 0.9 | 9 |
| 0.95 | 19 |
| 0.99 | 99 |

**Mnemonic:** "Alpha approaches One as Beta approaches Infinity"

**Key Features:**

- **Voltage Gain (Av)**: Approximately 1 (unity)
- **Current Gain (Ai)**: High (β + 1)
- **Input Impedance**: High (β × RE)
- **Output Impedance**: Low (1/gm) where gm is transconductance
- **Phase Relationship**: No phase inversion between input and output
- **Applications**: Impedance matching, buffers, voltage regulators

**Characteristics:**

- **Input Resistance**: Ri = β × (re + RL)
- **Output Resistance**: Ro = (rs + re)/(β + 1)
- **Voltage Gain**: Av = RL/(RL + re) ≈ 1
- **Current Gain**: Ai = (β + 1)

**Advantages:**

- Very high input impedance
- Low output impedance
- Good impedance matching properties
- No phase inversion

**Limitations:**

- No voltage gain (slightly less than 1)
- Used only for impedance matching

**Mnemonic:** "Collector Common, Current amplifies, Voltage follows"
