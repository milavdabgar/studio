The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of  the above- mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the development of this competency.

1. Work as a leader/a team member.
2. Follow ethical practices.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY:

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs  of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers.  If required,  more such higher  level UOs  could  be included by the  course teacher to focus  on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES:

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the  suggested  student-related cocurricular activities  which  can  be  undertaken  to  accelerate  the  attainment of  the various  outcomes  in this course:  Students  should  conduct  following  activities  in group and prepare reports of each activity.

-  Prepare chart to represent the CMOS design process
-  Prepare chart to represent the technological advancements in CMOS technology starting from  transistors to current technology
-  Project- Build a small ASIC  for your Home /Community.
-  Prepare chart  showing the types of FPGA technology
-  List out methods used in industries for each step used in CMOS design process.

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various  outcomes in this course:

- i. Show Video/ Animation film explaining VLSI Design which are available on internet.
- ii. Arrange expert lecture on VHDL programming for real life applications.
- iii. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- iv. Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine
- v. Visit  industries where equipment/gadgets using  VLSI are being  manufactured/ assembled.
- vii.  Guide student(s) in undertaking  micro-projects.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be  assigned  to him/her  in  the  beginning  of  the  semester.  In  the  first  four  semesters,  the  micro-project  is group-  based.  However,  in  the fifth  and sixth  semesters,  it  should be  preferably  be individually undertaken  to  build  up  the  skill  and  confidence  in  every  student  to  become problem  solver  so  that  s/he contributes to the projects  of the  industry. In special situations where groups  have to be formed  for  micro-projects,  the  number  of students  in the  group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are  in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs  and  ADOs.  Each student will have to  maintain dated  work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course.  The  student  ought  to submit micro-project  by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A  suggestive  list  of  micro-projects  is  given  here.  This  has  to  match  the  competency  and the  COs.  Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.
