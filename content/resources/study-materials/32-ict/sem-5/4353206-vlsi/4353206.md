- 0. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES:
Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in
group and prepare reports of each activity.
- Prepare chart to represent the CMOS design process
- Prepare chart to represent the technological advancements in CMOS
technology starting fromtransistors to current technology
- Project- Build a small ASIC for your Home /Community.
- Prepare chart showing the types of FPGA technology
- List out methods used in industries for each step used in CMOS design process.
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of
the variousoutcomes in this course:
- Show Video/ Animation film explaining VLSI Design which are available on
internet.
ii. Arrange expert lecture on VHDL programming for real life applications.
iii. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
iv. Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine
- Visit industries where equipment/gadgets using VLSI are being manufactured/
assembled.
vii. Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group- based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so thats/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

           which arein fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
           dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
           presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less
           than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit
           micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

         A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and
         the COs.Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.
