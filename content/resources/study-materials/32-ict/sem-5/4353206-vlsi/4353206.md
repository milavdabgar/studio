## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of each activity.

- Prepare chart to represent the CMOS design process
- Prepare chart to represent the technological advancements in CMOS technology starting from  transistors to current technology
- Project- Build a small ASIC  for your Home /Community.
- Prepare chart  showing the types of FPGA technology
- List out methods used in industries for each step used in CMOS design process.

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

1. Show Video/Animation film explaining VLSI Design which are available on internet
2. Arrange expert lecture on VHDL programming for real life applications
3. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics
4. Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine
5. Visit industries where equipment/gadgets using VLSI are being manufactured/assembled
6. Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.
