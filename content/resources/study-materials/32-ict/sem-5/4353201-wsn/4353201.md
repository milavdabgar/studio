Diploma programmer in which this course is offered                    Semester in which offered
Information & Communication Technology                                  Fifth

## 1. Rationale

In today’s world smart grid, smart homes, smart water networks, intelligent transportation,
smart infrastructure systems etc. Connect our world more than we ever thought possible.
The common vision of such systems is usually associated with one single concept, the
Internet of Things (IoT), where through the use of sensors, the entire physical infrastructure
is closely coupled with information and communication technologies; where intelligent
monitoring and management can be achieved via the usage of networked embedded devices.
In this course the students will learn and explore the use and evolution of WSNs within the
wider context of IoT and provide a review of WSN architecture framework, standards and
IoT based Applications.
## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
Competency through various teaching-learning experiences:

- Describe the fundamental principles of WSN and design application specific real-world
IoT systems.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
1. To demonstrate the fundamental architecture and key design issues in wireless sensor
networks.
2. To enlist the various protocols and its differences with traditional protocols in WSNs.
3. To familiarize with conceptual framework of IoT.
4. To demonstrate architecture and design principle of IoT for real time applications.
5. To design and develop real time application specific IoT systems.

- Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom’s taxonomy)*

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and
to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess
the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U
and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group
- Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Visit any Industry with IoT in your area and learn the IoT systems used in Industry/Realtime
applications.
- Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs to further enhance their
learning.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- About 10% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature
is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different
Assessment methods.
- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECT LIST

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three. The micro-project could be industry
application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each
