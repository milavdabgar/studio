## 1. RATIONALE

In today's world smart grid, smart homes, smart water networks, intelligent transportation, smart infrastructure systems etc. Connect our world more than we ever thought possible. The  common  vision  of  such  systems  is  usually  associated  with  one  single  concept,  the Internet of Things (IoT), where through the use of sensors, the entire physical infrastructure is  closely  coupled  with  information  and  communication  technologies;  where  intelligent monitoring and management can be achieved via the usage of networked embedded devices. In this course the students will learn and explore the use and evolution of WSNs within the wider context of IoT and provide a review of WSN architecture framework, standards and IoT based Applications.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified Competency through various teaching-learning experiences:

- Describe the fundamental principles of WSN and design application specific real-world IoT systems.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

## Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group

- a) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- b) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- c) Visit any Industry with IoT in your area and learn the IoT systems used in Industry/Realtime applications.
- d) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs to further enhance their learning.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b. Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c. About 10% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different Assessment methods.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECT LIST

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students  in  the  group  should  not  exceed  three.  The  micro-project  could  be  industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to submit one-two page report also.
