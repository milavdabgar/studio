## 3. Course Outcomes (COs)

1. To demonstrate the fundamental architecture and key design issues in wireless sensor networks.
2. To enlist the various protocols and its differences with traditional protocols in WSNs.
3. To familiarize with conceptual framework of IoT.
4. To demonstrate architecture and design principle of IoT for real time applications.
