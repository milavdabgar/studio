  "rationale": "In today's world smart grid, smart homes, smart water networks, intelligent transportation, smart infrastructure systems etc. Connect our world more than we ever thought possible. The common vision of such systems is usually associated with one single concept, the Internet of Things (IoT), where through the use of sensors, the entire physical infrastructure is closely coupled with information and communication technologies; where intelligent monitoring and management can be achieved via the usage of networked embedded devices. In this course the students will learn and explore the use and evolution of WSNs within the wider context of IoT and provide a review of WSN architecture framework, standards and IoT based Applications.",
