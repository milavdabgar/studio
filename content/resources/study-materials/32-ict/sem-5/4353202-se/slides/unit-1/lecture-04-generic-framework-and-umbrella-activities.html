                <h3>Understanding Umbrella Activities: Continuous Support</h3>
                <p>Umbrella activities are overarching, continuous activities that are applied throughout the entire software process. They are not sequential phases but rather ongoing practices that ensure the quality, management, and success of the project.</p>
                <p>They provide a protective layer over the core framework activities.</p>
