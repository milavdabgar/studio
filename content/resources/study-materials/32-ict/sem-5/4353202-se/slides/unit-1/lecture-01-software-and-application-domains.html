                <h3>Introduction: What is Software?</h3>
                <p>Software is more than just a collection of computer programs. It is a comprehensive set of programs, data, and documentation that enables a computer to perform specific tasks or functions.</p>
                <p><strong>Software = Computer Programs + Data + Documentation</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Computer Programs:</strong> Executable instructions that perform a specific function.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data:</strong> Information that programs process or produce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Written descriptions of the program's operation, usage, and development.</li>
                </ul>
                <aside class="notes">Emphasize that software is a complete product, not just code. Contrast with hardware.</aside>

                <h3>Understanding Software Characteristics</h3>
                <p>Software possesses unique characteristics that differentiate it from hardware and other engineered products.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intangible:</strong> Unlike hardware, software cannot be physically touched or felt. Its existence is logical, not physical.</li>
                    <li><strong>Developed or Engineered:</strong> Software is built through a systematic engineering process, involving design, coding, and testing, rather than being manufactured in a traditional assembly-line fashion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Does not 'wear out':</strong> Hardware components can wear out over time due to physical stress. Software, however, does not deteriorate physically. It might 'deteriorate' due to changes, bugs introduced during updates, or becoming obsolete.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Modern software systems can be incredibly complex, often involving millions of lines of code and intricate interactions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintainable:</strong> Software can be modified and updated to fix defects, improve performance, or adapt to new environments and requirements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Exploring Software Application Domains</h3>
                <p>Software is ubiquitous and serves diverse purposes across various industries. We can categorize software into several application domains based on its primary function and target environment.</p>

                <h3>Deep Dive: Embedded Software</h3>
                <p>Embedded software is a specialized category due to its unique constraints and operational environment.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Operation:</strong> Many embedded systems require immediate responses to events (e.g., airbag deployment in a car, flight control systems). Timeliness is critical.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Constraints:</strong> Often operates with limited memory (RAM, ROM), processing power, and energy (battery life). Optimization is paramount.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hardware Dependency:</strong> Tightly integrated with specific hardware components. Software development is often intertwined with hardware design.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability and Safety:</strong> Failures can have severe consequences (e.g., medical devices, industrial control systems), demanding extremely high reliability and safety standards.</li>
                </ul>
