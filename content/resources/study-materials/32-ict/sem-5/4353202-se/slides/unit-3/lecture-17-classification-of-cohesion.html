                <h3>Recap of Analysis vs. Design</h3>
                <p><strong>Analysis</strong> focuses on <strong>what</strong> the system should do (problem domain), while <strong>Design</strong> focuses on <strong>how</strong> the system will do it (solution domain).</p>
            </section>

                <h3>What is Cohesion?</h3>
                <p><strong>Cohesion</strong> is a measure of how strongly related and focused the responsibilities of a single module or class are. It describes the degree to which the elements within a module belong together.</p>
                <p>In simpler terms, it's about how well the internal parts of a module work together to achieve a single, well-defined purpose.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Why is Cohesion Important?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Improved Readability:</strong> Highly cohesive modules are easier to understand because they do one thing well.</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased Maintainability:</strong> Changes are localized within a module, reducing ripple effects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Reusability:</strong> Well-defined, single-purpose modules are easier to reuse in other parts of the system or in different projects.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Complexity:</strong> Breaking down a system into cohesive units reduces overall complexity.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>1. Coincidental Cohesion (Weakest)</h3>
                <p>Elements are grouped together for no apparent reason other than being in the same module. They have no meaningful relationship to each other.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A module named `Utilities` that contains functions like `calculateTax()`, `printReport()`, and `sendEmail()`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Changes to one function have no relation to others, making the module hard to understand and maintain.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>2. Logical Cohesion</h3>
                <p>Elements perform similar logical functions, but the specific function to be performed is selected by a control flag or parameter.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A module that performs all input/output operations, where a parameter determines if it's reading from a file, database, or network.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> The module has multiple responsibilities, and changes to one logical function might affect others.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>3. Temporal Cohesion</h3>
                <p>Elements are grouped because they are all processed at the same time or during the same phase of program execution.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A `startup()` module that initializes all system variables, opens log files, and establishes database connections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Functions are related by time, not by purpose. If a new startup activity is added, it might not logically belong with existing ones.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>4. Procedural Cohesion</h3>
                <p>Elements are grouped because they are part of a specific sequence of execution. The output of one element might be the input of another, but they don't necessarily operate on the same data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A module that contains functions for `readInput()`, `processData()`, and `writeOutput()`, where the order of execution is important.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Functions are related by control flow, not by data or purpose.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>5. Communicational Cohesion</h3>
                <p>Elements are grouped because they operate on the same input data or produce the same output data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A module that contains functions like `calculateEmployeeSalary()` and `updateEmployeeRecord()`, both operating on the `Employee` data structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Better than procedural, as functions are related by data.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>6. Sequential Cohesion</h3>
                <p>Elements are grouped because the output of one element serves as the input for the next element. This is a strong form of cohesion, often found in data processing pipelines.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A module with `readSensorData()`, `filterNoise()`, and `storeProcessedData()`. The output of `readSensorData()` is input to `filterNoise()`, and its output is input to `storeProcessedData()`.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Clear flow of data and responsibility.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>7. Functional Cohesion (Strongest)</h3>
                <p>Elements are grouped because they all contribute to a single, well-defined function or task. The module performs one and only one task, and all its elements are essential for that task.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Example:</strong> A module named `CalculateSquareRoot` that contains all the logic and sub-functions required to compute the square root of a number.</li>
                    <li><strong>Benefit:</strong> Highly reusable, easy to understand, and simple to maintain. This is the ideal level of cohesion.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Goal: High Cohesion</h3>
                <p>In software design, the goal is to achieve **Functional Cohesion** as much as possible. If not, then **Sequential** or **Communicational Cohesion** are also considered good.</p>
                <p>Avoid **Coincidental**, **Logical**, and **Temporal Cohesion** as they lead to poor design and maintenance issues.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Cohesion** measures how related elements within a module are.</li>
                    <li>Higher cohesion leads to better **readability, maintainability, and reusability**.</li>
                    <li>**Functional Cohesion** is the strongest and most desirable type.</li>
                    <li>Understanding cohesion helps in designing **robust and flexible** software systems.</li>
                </ul>
