                <h3>Recap of Functional Requirements</h3>
                <p>Functional requirements define <strong>what</strong> a system should do. They describe the specific behaviors, functions, and features of the system.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What are Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)?</h3>
                <p>Non-functional requirements define <strong>how</strong> a system should perform a certain function. They are the quality attributes of a system, such as performance, security, and reliability.</p>
                <p>They do not affect the basic functionality of the system, but they have a critical impact on the user experience.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Categories of NFRs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> How fast the system responds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> How well the system can handle a growing amount of work.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> The ability of the system to perform its required functions under stated conditions for a specified period of time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> The ability of the system to protect information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usability:</strong> The ease with which a user can learn to operate, prepare inputs for, and interpret outputs of a system or component.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> The ease with which a software system or component can be modified to correct faults, improve performance, or adapt to a changed environment.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Examples of NFRs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> The system shall load the user dashboard in under 3 seconds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system shall support up to 10,000 concurrent users.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> The system shall have 99.9% uptime.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security:</strong> All user passwords must be stored in an encrypted format.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usability:</strong> A new user should be able to complete the registration process in under 2 minutes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> The code shall follow the specified coding standards.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h3>Importance of NFRs</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>User Satisfaction:</strong> A system that is slow, unreliable, or difficult to use will not be successful, even if it has all the right features.</li>
                    <li><strong>System Success:</strong> NFRs are often the difference between a successful and an unsuccessful project.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost of Failure:</strong> Ignoring NFRs can lead to costly failures, such as security breaches or system crashes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Legal and Compliance:</strong> Many NFRs are driven by legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Non-functional requirements** define the **quality attributes** of a system.</li>
                    <li>They are the **"how"** of the system, as opposed to the "what" of functional requirements.</li>
                    <li>They are critical for **user satisfaction** and the overall **success of the project**.</li>
                    <li>They should be **specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)**.</li>
                </ul>
