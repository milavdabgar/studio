                <h3>Recap of Sequence Diagrams</h3>
                <p>Sequence Diagrams show time-ordered interactions between objects, depicting the sequence of messages exchanged to achieve a specific functionality. They are excellent for understanding dynamic system behavior.</p>

                <h3>What is an Activity Diagram?</h3>
                <p>An <strong>Activity Diagram</strong> is a behavioral UML diagram that illustrates the flow of control or data in a system. It shows the sequence of activities performed to achieve a goal, highlighting the decisions, parallel processes, and paths within a workflow.</p>
                <p>It is similar to a flowchart but specifically designed for object-oriented systems.</p>

                <h3>Components of an Activity Diagram</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Activity:</strong> Represents a single step or action in a process. (Rounded rectangle)</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Node:</strong> Represents the starting point of the activity flow. (Solid circle)</li>
                    <li><strong>Final Node:</strong> Represents the end point of the activity flow. (Bullseye)</li>
                    <li><strong>Control Flow (Edge):</strong> Represents the transition from one activity to another. (Arrow)</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Node:</strong> Represents a point where a decision is made, leading to different paths. (Diamond)</li>
                    <li><strong>Merge Node:</strong> Represents a point where different paths converge. (Diamond)</li>
                    <li><strong>Fork Node:</strong> Represents a point where a single flow splits into multiple parallel flows. (Thick horizontal or vertical bar)</li>
                    <li><strong>Join Node:</strong> Represents a point where multiple parallel flows converge into a single flow. (Thick horizontal or vertical bar)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Example: Online Order Processing Activity Diagram</h3>
                <div class="mermaid">
                    graph TD
                        start((start)) --> A[Receive Order]
                        A --> B{Check Stock}
                        B -- In Stock --> C[Process Payment]
                        B -- Out of Stock --> D[Notify Customer Out of Stock]

                <h3>Advantages of Activity Diagrams</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Workflow Visualization:</strong> Provides a clear visual representation of business workflows and processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Parallel Activities:</strong> Effectively models concurrent and parallel activities using Fork and Join nodes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Points:</strong> Clearly shows decision points and alternative paths within a process.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Easy for both technical and business stakeholders to understand the flow of activities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Process Improvement:</strong> Helps in identifying bottlenecks and areas for process optimization.</li>
                </ul>
