					<h2>Unit 2: Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h2>
					<p>Software Engineering (4353202)</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>2.1: Introduction to SDLC</h3>
					<p>The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a process used by the software industry to design, develop, and test high quality softwares.</p>
					<div class="mermaid">
						graph LR
							A[Requirements Analysis] --> B[System Design]
							B --> C[Implementation]
							C --> D[Testing]
							D --> E[Deployment]
							E --> F[Maintenance]
							F --> A
					</div>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>2.2: Waterfall & Incremental Models</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>Waterfall Model</h4>
						<div class="mermaid">
							graph LR
								A[Requirements] --> B[Design]
								B --> C[Implementation]
								C --> D[Testing]
								D --> E[Deployment]
								E --> F[Maintenance]
						</div>
						<p>A sequential design process in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Incremental Model</h4>
						<div class="mermaid">
							graph LR
								A[Core Product] --> B[Increment 1]
								B --> C[Increment 2]
								C --> D[Increment 3]
								D --> E[Final Product]
						</div>
						<p>The incremental build model is a method of software development where the model is designed, implemented and tested incrementally (a little more is added each time) until the product is finished.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>2.3: Prototype & Spiral Models</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>Prototype Model</h4>
						<p>The prototyping model is a systems development method (SDM) in which a prototype (an early approximation of a final system or product) is built, tested, and then reworked as necessary until an acceptable prototype is finally achieved from which the complete system or product can now be developed.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Spiral Model</h4>
						<div class="mermaid">
							graph LR
								A[Planning] --> B[Risk Analysis]
								B --> C[Engineering]
								C --> D[Evaluation]
								D --> A
						</div>
						<p>The spiral model is a risk-driven software development process model. Based on the unique risk patterns of a given project, the spiral model guides a team to adopt elements of one or more process models, such as incremental, waterfall, or evolutionary prototyping.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>2.4: RAD & Agile Models</h3>
					<section>
						<h4>RAD Model</h4>
						<p>Rapid application development (RAD) is a software development methodology that uses minimal planning in favor of rapid prototyping. A prototype is a working model that is functionally equivalent to a component of the product.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Agile Model</h4>
						<p>Agile software development refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Scrum</h4>
						<div class="mermaid">
							graph LR
								A[Product Backlog] --> B[Sprint Planning]
								B --> C[Sprint Backlog]
								C --> D[Sprint 2-4 weeks]
								D --> E[Sprint Review]
								E --> F[Sprint Retrospective]
								F --> B
								D --> G[Daily Scrum]
								G --> D
						</div>
						<p>Scrum is an agile framework for managing knowledge work, with an emphasis on software development.</p>
