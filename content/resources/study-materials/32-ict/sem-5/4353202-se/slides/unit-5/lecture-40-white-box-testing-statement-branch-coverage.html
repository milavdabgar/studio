                <h3>Recap of Black Box Testing (BVA)</h3>
                <p>Boundary Value Analysis (BVA) is a black box testing technique that focuses on testing values at the extreme ends of input ranges (Min, Min+1, Max-1, Max, Min-1, Max+1) to find defects, often complementing Equivalence Partitioning.</p>

                <h3>What is White Box Testing?</h3>
                <p><strong>White Box Testing</strong> (also known as Clear Box Testing, Glass Box Testing, or Structural Testing) is a software testing method that examines the internal structure, design, and implementation of the system being tested.</p>
                <p>The tester has knowledge of the internal workings of the code, including its logic, paths, and data structures.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Why White Box Testing?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Thoroughness:</strong> Ensures that all independent paths within a module have been exercised.</li>
                    <li><strong>Early Defect Detection:</strong> Helps in finding logical errors, design flaws, and coding mistakes early.</li>
                    <li><strong>Code Optimization:</strong> Can identify dead code or inefficient sections.</li>
                    <li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> Helps uncover security flaws in the code logic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Completeness:</strong> Provides a measure of how much of the code has been tested.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Code Coverage Metrics</h3>
                <p>Code coverage metrics are used in white box testing to measure the percentage of code that has been executed by a test suite. They provide an indication of the thoroughness of testing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statement Coverage:</strong> Measures if every executable statement has been executed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Branch Coverage:</strong> Measures if every branch (true/false) of decision points has been executed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Path Coverage:</strong> Measures if every possible path through the code has been executed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Condition Coverage:</strong> Measures if every boolean sub-expression has been evaluated to both true and false.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Statement Coverage</h3>
                <p><strong>Statement Coverage</strong> ensures that every executable statement in the source code has been executed at least once during testing.</p>
                <p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Number of Executed Statements / Total Number of Statements) * 100%</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">public void example(int x) {
    if (x > 0) { // Statement 1
        System.out.println("Positive"); // Statement 2
    } else {
        System.out.println("Non-positive"); // Statement 3
    }
    System.out.println("Done"); // Statement 4
}</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Test Case:</strong> `example(5)` executes Statements 1, 2, 4. (75% coverage)</p>
                <p><strong>Test Case:</strong> `example(-2)` executes Statements 1, 3, 4. (75% coverage)</p>
                <p><strong>To achieve 100% Statement Coverage:</strong> Need both `example(5)` and `example(-2)`.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Branch Coverage</h3>
                <p><strong>Branch Coverage</strong> (also known as Decision Coverage) ensures that every branch (true/false) of every decision point (e.g., `if`, `else`, `switch`, `loops`) in the code has been executed at least once.</p>
                <p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Number of Executed Branches / Total Number of Branches) * 100%</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">public void checkEligibility(int age) {
    if (age >= 18) { // Decision Point
        System.out.println("Eligible to vote"); // Branch 1 (True)
    } else {
        System.out.println("Not eligible to vote"); // Branch 2 (False)
    }
}</code></pre>
                <p><strong>To achieve 100% Branch Coverage:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Test Case 1: `checkEligibility(20)` (executes Branch 1 - True)</li>
                    <li>Test Case 2: `checkEligibility(16)` (executes Branch 2 - False)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
