                <h3>Recap of Statement & Branch Coverage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Statement Coverage:</strong> Ensures every executable line of code is executed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Branch Coverage:</strong> Ensures every decision path (true/false) is exercised.</li>
                    <li>Branch coverage is a stronger form of testing than statement coverage.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is Path Coverage?</h3>
                <p><strong>Path Coverage</strong> ensures that every possible independent path through the code is executed at least once. An independent path is a path through the code that introduces at least one new set of processing statements or a new condition.</p>
                <p>This is the most comprehensive form of code coverage, but also the most difficult to achieve, especially for complex programs.</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">public void example(int a, int b) {
    if (a > 0) { // Path 1
        if (b > 0) { // Path 2
            System.out.println("Both positive"); // Path 3
        } else {
            System.out.println("A positive, B non-positive"); // Path 4
        }
    } else {
        System.out.println("A non-positive"); // Path 5
    }
}</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Possible Paths:</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>a > 0, b > 0</li>
                    <li>a > 0, b <= 0</li>
                    <li>a <= 0</li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is Condition Coverage?</h3>
                <p><strong>Condition Coverage</strong> ensures that every boolean sub-expression (condition) within a decision statement has been evaluated to both true and false at least once.</p>
                <p>This is particularly useful for complex conditional statements involving logical operators (AND, OR, NOT).</p>
                <pre><code class="language-java">public void checkDiscount(int age, boolean isMember) {
    if (age >= 65 && isMember) { // Condition: (age >= 65) AND (isMember)
        System.out.println("Senior Member Discount");
    } else {
        System.out.println("No Discount");
    }
}</code></pre>
                <p><strong>Conditions to test:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>`age >= 65` (True and False)</li>
                    <li>`isMember` (True and False)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Advantages of Path & Condition Coverage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Thoroughness:</strong> Path coverage provides the most comprehensive testing of code logic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reveals Hidden Bugs:</strong> Condition coverage can uncover bugs in complex logical expressions that might be missed by branch coverage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Code Quality:</strong> Encourages developers to write cleaner, more testable code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced Risk:</strong> Minimizes the risk of untested code paths or logical errors in critical conditions.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Disadvantages of Path & Condition Coverage</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High Complexity:</strong> The number of paths can grow exponentially with decision points, making 100% path coverage impractical for large programs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time-Consuming:</strong> Requires significant effort to identify and create test cases for all paths and conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Always Feasible:</strong> Some paths or conditions might be unreachable or logically impossible to test.</li>
                    <li><strong>Doesn't Guarantee Correctness:</strong> Even 100% coverage doesn't guarantee the absence of all bugs (e.g., missing functionality).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Path Coverage** tests every independent path through the code, offering the highest level of thoroughness.</li>
                    <li>**Condition Coverage** ensures every boolean sub-expression evaluates to both true and false.</li>
                    <li>These are advanced white box techniques that provide **deeper insight into code logic** but come with **higher complexity and effort**.</li>
                </ul>
