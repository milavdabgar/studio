                <h3>Recap of Analytical Estimation</h3>
                <p>Analytical estimation uses mathematical models (like Putnam's, Function Points with productivity, and COCOMO) for objective and repeatable project estimates, requiring more data and expertise than heuristic methods.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is Project Scheduling?</h3>
                <p><strong>Project scheduling</strong> is the process of listing activities, deliverables, and milestones within a project, and then arranging them in a logical sequence with start and end dates. It involves allocating resources and defining dependencies between tasks.</p>
                <p>Effective scheduling is crucial for managing project timelines, ensuring timely delivery, and optimizing resource utilization.</p>

                <h3>Introduction to Gantt Charts</h3>
                <p>A <strong>Gantt Chart</strong> is a visual project management tool that illustrates a project schedule. It is a type of bar chart that shows the start and end dates of project activities, along with their dependencies.</p>
                <p>Gantt charts are widely used for planning, scheduling, and monitoring project progress.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Components of a Gantt Chart</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Tasks/Activities:</strong> Individual work items that need to be completed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> A horizontal axis representing the project duration, broken down into days, weeks, or months.</li>
                    <li><strong>Bars:</strong> Horizontal bars representing each task, with the length indicating the duration of the task.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependencies:</strong> Arrows connecting tasks, showing which tasks must be completed before others can start.</li>
                    <li><strong>Milestones:</strong> Significant points or events in the project, often represented by diamonds.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resources:</strong> Can be assigned to tasks to show who is responsible for what.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Advantages of Gantt Charts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Visual Clarity:</strong> Provides a clear, visual overview of the entire project schedule.</li>
                    <li><strong>Easy to Understand:</strong> Simple to interpret for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</li>
                    <li><strong>Progress Tracking:</strong> Allows for easy tracking of task progress and overall project status.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dependency Management:</strong> Clearly shows task dependencies, helping to identify critical paths.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Can be used to visualize and manage resource assignments.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Disadvantages of Gantt Charts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Complexity for Large Projects:</strong> Can become overly complex and difficult to manage for very large projects with many tasks and dependencies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Lack of Flexibility:</strong> Not ideal for projects with frequently changing requirements or agile methodologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Doesn't Show Resource Overload:</strong> While resources can be assigned, it doesn't inherently show if a resource is over-allocated.</li>
                    <li><strong>Focus on Schedule, Not Effort:</strong> Primarily shows timelines, not necessarily the effort involved in each task.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
