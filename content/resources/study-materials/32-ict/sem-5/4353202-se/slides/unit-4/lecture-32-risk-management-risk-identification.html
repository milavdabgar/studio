                <h3>Recap of Sprint Burn Down Charts</h3>
                <p>Sprint Burn Down Charts visually track the remaining work in a sprint against time, helping agile teams monitor progress and identify deviations from the planned burn down.</p>

                <h3>What is Risk Management?</h3>
                <p><strong>Risk Management</strong> is a systematic process of identifying, analyzing, planning responses to, and monitoring risks throughout the project lifecycle. Its goal is to minimize the potential negative impacts of risks on project objectives.</p>
                <p>In software engineering, risks are potential problems that may affect the project's success, quality, or schedule.</p>
            </section>

                <h3>The Risk Management Process</h3>

                <h3>What is Risk Identification?</h3>
                <p><strong>Risk Identification</strong> is the first step in the risk management process. It involves systematically discovering, recognizing, and describing potential risks that could affect the project.</p>
                <p>The objective is to identify as many potential risks as possible, regardless of their likelihood or impact, to ensure they can be further analyzed and managed.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Categories of Software Risks</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Project Risks:</strong> Threaten the project plan (e.g., schedule delays, budget overruns, resource shortages).</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Risks:</strong> Threaten the quality and timeliness of the software (e.g., new technology challenges, integration issues, performance problems).</li>
                    <li><strong>Business Risks:</strong> Threaten the viability of the software or the project (e.g., market changes, competition, loss of funding).</li>
                    <li><strong>External Risks:</strong> Beyond the control of the project team (e.g., regulatory changes, natural disasters, vendor issues).</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Techniques for Risk Identification</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Brainstorming:</strong> Team members collectively identify potential risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Checklists:</strong> Using predefined lists of common risks from past projects or industry standards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interviews:</strong> Discussing potential risks with stakeholders, experts, and team members.</li>
                    <li><strong>SWOT Analysis:</strong> Analyzing Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to identify internal and external risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Root Cause Analysis:</strong> Investigating past problems to identify underlying causes that could lead to future risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Delphi Technique:</strong> A structured method for reaching a consensus among experts on potential risks.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The Risk Register</h3>
                <p>A <strong>Risk Register</strong> is a document that records all identified risks and their attributes. It is a key output of the risk identification process and is continuously updated throughout the project.</p>
                <h4>Typical Information in a Risk Register:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk ID and Description</li>
                    <li>Risk Category (e.g., Project, Technical)</li>
                    <li>Potential Causes</li>
                    <li>Potential Impact</li>
                    <li>Owner (person responsible for managing the risk)</li>
                    <li>Status (e.g., Open, Closed)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
