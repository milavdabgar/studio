                <h3>Recap of Risk Assessment</h3>
                <p>Risk Assessment involves evaluating the probability and impact of identified risks to determine their severity and prioritize them, often using tools like a Risk Matrix.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is Risk Control?</h3>
                <p><strong>Risk Control</strong> (also known as Risk Response Planning and Risk Monitoring) is the process of developing options and actions to enhance opportunities and to reduce threats to project objectives.</p>
                <p>It involves deciding on a course of action for each identified and assessed risk.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Risk Response Strategies</h3>
                <p>Once risks are assessed, a strategy must be chosen for each. These strategies aim to either prevent the risk from occurring or minimize its impact.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Avoidance:</strong> Eliminating the threat or risk by removing its cause. (e.g., changing scope, using proven technology)</li>
                    <li><strong>Mitigation:</strong> Reducing the probability or impact of a risk event to an acceptable threshold. (e.g., conducting more testing, training staff)</li>
                    <li><strong>Transfer:</strong> Shifting the responsibility for the risk to a third party. (e.g., insurance, outsourcing)</li>
                    <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> Deciding to take no action and deal with the consequences if the risk occurs. (e.g., for low-impact, low-probability risks)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Risk Monitoring</h3>
                <p><strong>Risk Monitoring</strong> is the process of tracking identified risks, monitoring residual risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating the effectiveness of risk response plans throughout the project.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Activities:</strong> Regular review meetings, tracking risk indicators, updating the risk register.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To ensure that risk responses are effective and to identify any new or changing risks.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Risk Mitigation Planning</h3>
                <p>For each significant risk, a detailed mitigation plan should be developed. This plan outlines the specific actions to be taken to reduce the risk.</p>
                <h4>Components of a Mitigation Plan:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Trigger:</strong> What event indicates the risk is about to occur or has occurred?</li>
                    <li><strong>Response Actions:</strong> Specific steps to take.</li>
                    <li><strong>Owner:</strong> Who is responsible for executing the plan?</li>
                    <li><strong>Resources:</strong> What resources are needed for the response?</li>
                    <li><strong>Contingency Plan:</strong> What to do if the primary mitigation fails.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>**Risk Control** involves developing strategies and monitoring risks.</li>
                    <li>Main strategies are **Avoidance, Mitigation, Transfer, and Acceptance**.</li>
                    <li>**Risk Monitoring** is crucial for tracking risks and effectiveness of responses.</li>
                    <li>Effective risk control leads to **proactive problem-solving** and **improved project success**.</li>
                </ul>
