                <h3>Recap of Heuristic Estimation</h3>
                <p>Heuristic estimation relies on expert judgment, analogy, and consensus (Delphi) for quick, experience-based estimates. They are flexible but can be subjective.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is Analytical Estimation?</h3>
                <p><strong>Analytical estimation techniques</strong> are based on mathematical formulas and models derived from the underlying structure of the software development process. They attempt to predict effort, cost, and schedule by analyzing the relationships between various project parameters.</p>
                <p>These techniques are more formal and objective than heuristic methods.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Technique 1: Putnam's Norden/Rayleigh Curve</h3>
                <p>This model, developed by Lawrence Putnam, is based on the observation that software development effort and staffing levels follow a Rayleigh distribution curve over time.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Concept:</strong> Effort and staff build up slowly, peak, and then decline as the project nears completion.</li>
                    <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Relates effort, time, and productivity parameters.</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Provides insights into staffing levels over time, useful for long-term planning.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Assumes a fixed development process, less flexible for iterative models, and parameters can be hard to determine accurately.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Technique 2: Function Point Analysis (Revisited)</h3>
                <p>While Function Points (FP) are a size metric, they are also a core component of analytical estimation when used with productivity rates.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Concept:</strong> Once FP are calculated, historical productivity data (e.g., person-hours per FP) can be used to estimate effort.</li>
                    <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Effort = Function Points / Productivity Rate</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Language-independent, focuses on functionality, and can be estimated early.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Subjectivity in FP counting, and accurate productivity data is essential.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Technique 3: COCOMO (Revisited as Analytical)</h3>
                <p>The COCOMO model, particularly its Intermediate and Detailed versions, can be considered an analytical model because it uses mathematical formulas and adjusts them based on various project attributes (cost drivers).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Concept:</strong> Effort = a * (KLOC)^b * EAF (Effort Adjustment Factor).</li>
                    <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> Widely accepted, provides a structured approach, and accounts for various project complexities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Disadvantages:</strong> Relies on accurate KLOC estimation, and the EAF values can be subjective.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Advantages of Analytical Techniques</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Objectivity:</strong> Based on mathematical models, reducing subjectivity and bias.</li>
                    <li><strong>Repeatability:</strong> Given the same inputs, the models produce the same estimates.</li>
                    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> The underlying assumptions and calculations are explicit.</li>
                    <li><strong>Predictive Power:</strong> Can provide more accurate estimates for complex projects, especially when calibrated with historical data.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Disadvantages of Analytical Techniques</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Data Dependency:</strong> Require significant historical data for calibration and validation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Complexity:</strong> Can be complex to understand and apply, requiring specialized knowledge.</li>
                    <li><strong>Rigidity:</strong> May not adapt well to unique or rapidly changing project environments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Initial Effort:</strong> Setting up and calibrating these models can be time-consuming.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
