                <h3>Recap of Project Manager Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>Software Project Managers are responsible for planning, organizing, leading, controlling, communicating, and managing risks to ensure successful project delivery.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>What is Project Size Estimation?</h3>
                <p>Project size estimation is the process of predicting the amount of effort, time, and resources required to develop a software system. It is a crucial step in project planning.</p>
                <p>Accurate size estimation is fundamental for effective project management, including scheduling, budgeting, and resource allocation.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Importance of Size Estimation</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Accurate Planning:</strong> Provides a basis for realistic schedules and budgets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Allocation:</strong> Helps in determining the number of people and other resources needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Early identification of potential project risks related to size and complexity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance Measurement:</strong> Allows for tracking project progress and productivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Making:</strong> Supports go/no-go decisions for projects.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Metric 1: Lines of Code (LOC)</h3>
                <p><strong>Lines of Code (LOC)</strong> is one of the oldest and most intuitive metrics for software size estimation. It measures the size of a software program by counting the number of lines in the source code.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Physical LOC:</strong> Counts every line of text in the program, including comments and blank lines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logical LOC:</strong> Counts executable statements, excluding comments and blank lines.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Advantages of LOC</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Easy to Measure:</strong> Once the code is written, it's straightforward to count.</li>
                    <li><strong>Intuitive:</strong> Easy for non-technical stakeholders to understand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Historical Data:</strong> Many organizations have historical data based on LOC, which can be used for future estimations.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Disadvantages of LOC</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Language Dependent:</strong> A function implemented in C++ might take fewer lines than in Java or Python.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Direct Relation to Effort:</strong> A complex line of code might take more effort than several simple lines.</li>
                    <li><strong>Difficulty in Early Estimation:</strong> Cannot be accurately measured until coding is well underway.</li>
                    <li><strong>Does Not Account for Quality:</strong> More lines of code do not necessarily mean better quality or more functionality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Counting Conventions Vary:</strong> Different organizations may have different rules for counting LOC.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Metric 2: Function Points (FP)</h3>
                <p><strong>Function Points (FP)</strong> is a software size estimation metric that measures the functionality provided to the user, based on the system's external interfaces and logical design.</p>
                <p>It is independent of the programming language, development technology, or project methodology.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Components of Function Points</h3>
                <p>Function Points are calculated by counting five types of user functions and adjusting them for complexity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>External Inputs (EI):</strong> Data or control information entering the system from outside. (e.g., user login screen, data entry form)</li>
                    <li><strong>External Outputs (EO):</strong> Data or control information leaving the system. (e.g., reports, error messages)</li>
                    <li><strong>External Inquiries (EQ):</strong> A request that retrieves data from the system. (e.g., search query, help screen)</li>
                    <li><strong>Internal Logical Files (ILF):</strong> Logical files or data groups maintained within the system. (e.g., customer database, product catalog)</li>
                    <li><strong>External Interface Files (EIF):</strong> Logical files or data groups referenced by the system but maintained by another system. (e.g., external payment gateway data)</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Function Point Calculation (Simplified)</h3>
                <p>1. Count the number of occurrences for each of the five components.</p>
                <p>2. Assign a complexity weight (simple, average, complex) to each count.</p>
                <p>3. Sum the weighted counts to get the Unadjusted Function Points (UFP).</p>
                <p>4. Apply a Value Adjustment Factor (VAF) based on 14 general system characteristics (e.g., data communication, distributed processing, performance). This results in the final Function Points (FP).</p>
                <p><strong>FP = UFP * VAF</strong></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Advantages of Function Points</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Language Independent:</strong> Can be estimated early in the SDLC, even before coding begins.</li>
                    <li><strong>Business-Oriented:</strong> Focuses on the functionality delivered to the user, making it easier for business stakeholders to understand.</li>
                    <li><strong>Consistent:</strong> Provides a more consistent measure of size across different projects and technologies.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better for Comparison:</strong> Allows for benchmarking and comparison of productivity across different teams or projects.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Disadvantages of Function Points</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Subjectivity:</strong> Counting and complexity assignment can be subjective and require trained personnel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Time-Consuming:</strong> Can be more complex and time-consuming to calculate than LOC.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not Widely Understood:</strong> Less intuitive for non-technical people compared to LOC.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Standard Tool:</strong> Lack of widely accepted automated tools for FP counting.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>

                    <li>**LOC** is simple but language-dependent and hard to estimate early.</li>
