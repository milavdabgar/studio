                <h3>What is the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)?</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</strong> is a systematic, phased approach to developing software. It provides a structured framework that guides the entire process of building, deploying, and maintaining software systems.</p>
                <p>Think of it as a project management model that defines the stages involved in an information system development project, from an initial feasibility study through maintenance of the completed application.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Why is SDLC Essential? (Purpose and Benefits)</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Structured Approach:</strong> Provides a clear roadmap for project execution, reducing chaos and improving predictability.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Integrates testing and quality checks throughout the process, leading to higher quality software.</li>
                    <li><strong>Risk Management:</strong> Helps identify and mitigate risks early, reducing potential project failures and cost overruns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> By catching errors early and planning thoroughly, SDLC helps reduce overall development costs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stakeholder Communication:</strong> Ensures clear communication and understanding among all parties involved (developers, clients, users).</li>
                    <li><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> Facilitates better allocation and utilization of human and technical resources.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintainability:</strong> Well-documented and structured development makes future maintenance and enhancements easier.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Core Phases of the SDLC</h3>
                <p>While specific activities may vary between different SDLC models, most follow a common set of core phases:</p>

                <h3>Introduction to SDLC Models</h3>
                <p>The SDLC phases can be implemented in various ways, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, depending on project characteristics. These different approaches are known as SDLC Models.</p>
                <p>In the upcoming lectures, we will explore several popular models, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Waterfall Model (Linear)</li>
                    <li>Incremental Model (Iterative, phased delivery)</li>
                    <li>Prototype Model (Early working model)</li>
                    <li>Spiral Model (Risk-driven, iterative)</li>
                    <li>Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model (Fast prototyping)</li>
                    <li>Agile Models (e.g., Scrum, Extreme Programming - XP) (Flexible, iterative, collaborative)</li>
