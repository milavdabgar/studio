                <h3>Recap of SDLC Introduction</h3>
                <p>The SDLC is a systematic, phased approach to software development, encompassing Requirement Analysis, System Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. It provides a structured framework for building high-quality software.</p>

                <h3>Historical Context of the Waterfall Model</h3>
                <p>The Waterfall Model is one of the oldest and most traditional SDLC models. It was first formally described by Winston W. Royce in 1970, though he presented it as a flawed model that needed significant modifications.</p>
                <p>Despite Royce's original intent, the simple, linear representation became widely adopted, particularly in large-scale government and defense projects, due to its clear structure and emphasis on documentation.</p>

                <h3>What is the Waterfall Model?</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Waterfall Model</strong> is a sequential, linear software development model. In this model, each phase must be completed and reviewed before the next phase can begin, and there is no overlapping in the phases.</p>
                <p>The output of one phase serves as the input for the next phase, flowing downwards like a waterfall.</p>

                <h3>Advantages of the Waterfall Model</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simplicity and Clarity:</strong> Easy to understand, manage, and follow due to its rigid, linear structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Clear Deliverables:</strong> Each phase has specific, well-defined deliverables and review processes, providing clear milestones.</li>
                    <li><strong>Strong Documentation:</strong> Emphasizes comprehensive documentation at each stage, which is useful for knowledge transfer and future maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Good for Small, Stable Projects:</strong> Works well for projects where requirements are very well understood, stable, and not expected to change.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Inflexibility:</strong> Very difficult and costly to go back and change requirements once a phase is completed. This is its biggest drawback.</li>
                    <li><strong>Late Delivery of Working Software:</strong> No working software is produced until late in the life cycle, making it hard to get early customer feedback.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Risk and Uncertainty:</strong> Not suitable for complex or long-term projects where requirements are likely to evolve. Risks are often discovered late.</li>
                    <li><strong>Limited Customer Involvement:</strong> Customer interaction is primarily at the requirements phase, leading to potential misalignment with actual needs.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h3>When to Use the Waterfall Model</h3>
                <p>The Waterfall model is best suited for projects where:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Requirements are **very well known, clear, and fixed** from the outset.</li>
                    <li>The product definition is **stable** and unlikely to change.</li>
                    <li>The technology used is **well-understood** and not dynamic.</li>
                    <li>There are **no ambiguous requirements**.</li>
                    <li>The project is **short** and simple.</li>
                    <li>Strict **regulatory compliance** or extensive documentation is required.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h3>Summary and Q&A</h3>
                <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The **Waterfall Model** is a **sequential, linear** SDLC model, where each phase completes before the next begins.</li>
                    <li>It emphasizes **planning and documentation**, making it simple to manage.</li>
                    <li>Its primary weakness is **inflexibility** and the difficulty of accommodating changes.</li>
                    <li>Best suited for **small, stable projects** with clear, unchanging requirements.</li>
                </ul>
