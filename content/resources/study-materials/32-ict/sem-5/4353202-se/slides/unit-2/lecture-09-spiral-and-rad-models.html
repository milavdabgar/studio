                <h3>Recap of the Prototype Model</h3>
                <p>The Prototype Model involves building an early working model to clarify requirements and gather feedback. It is iterative and user-centric, especially useful when requirements are unclear.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The Spiral Model: A Risk-Driven Approach</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Spiral Model</strong> is an iterative and risk-driven software development process model. It combines elements of both design and prototyping in stages, with a strong emphasis on risk analysis and management in each iteration.</p>
                <p>It is particularly suited for large, complex, and high-risk projects where requirements may evolve.</p>

                <h3>The RAD Model: Rapid Application Development</h3>
                <p>The <strong>Rapid Application Development (RAD) Model</strong> is an incremental software development process model that emphasizes rapid prototyping and quick feedback over extensive planning. It aims to deliver working software quickly, often within a short timeframe (e.g., 60-90 days).</p>
                <p>RAD focuses on using reusable components, powerful development tools, and close collaboration with users.</p>
