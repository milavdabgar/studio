## 1. Rationale

Software engineering offers a structured framework for creating applications and software.
Through this study, students gain the ability to develop and design software to specific needs.
It encompasses analyzing and designing systems through various steps and teaches systematic
project preparation. This course teaches you how to break down and plan out systems step by
step. You learn how to organize projects in a smart way. By studying different parts of
software engineering, you understand what it takes to design and make projects work
smoothly.

## 2. Competency

The course content should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop various types
of related skills leading to the achievement of the following competency

- Identify and analyze problems in the field of Software development.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical experiences and relevant soft skills associated with this course are to be taught
and implemented, so that the student demonstrates the following industry-oriented COs
associated with the above-mentioned competency:

- Describe Generic framework activity and Umbrella activity.
- Differentiate various software development process models.
- Prepare SRS as well as draw DFD and object-oriented UML diagrams.
- Create software development plan using project scheduling.
- Prepare test-cases to test software functionalities.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major Underpinning Theory is formulated as given below and only higher level UOs of
Revised Bloom’s taxonomy are mentioned for development of the COs and competency in the
students by the teachers. (Higher level UOs automatically includes lower level UOs in them).
If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on
attainment of COs and competency.

and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions
assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy
levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary from above table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare
small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro project report should be as per
suggested format, for other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of
the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos
of the activities for their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement
interviews:
- Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- Prepare charts for various models, SDLC life cycles, UML notations etc.
- Prepare SRS documents based on case study.
- Discuss various case studies available on internet.
- An hour of problem solving for various case study topics may be organized and
students are encouraged to participate

- Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam,
edx, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.
- Encourage students to interact with the industry person to discuss and gather
information of current trends, models, documentation, testing methods and different
tools used in industry.

## 11. Suggested Special Instructional Strategies

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- Managing Learning Environment
- Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help for students.
- Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the course
material at his or her pace.
- Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be
enhanced.
- ‘CI” in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the
knowledge of this course

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are
group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The total work load on each student due to the micro-
project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per
week) during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the
semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).
        A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with
competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the
concerned course teacher:
- Case study on attendance management system
- Case study on vehicle rental system
- Case study on hospital appointment booking
- Case study on gym management system
- Case study on Tours and Travel Management
- Case study on hostel management system
