## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

The major Underpinning Theory is formulated as given below and only higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy are mentioned for development of the COs and competency in the students by the teachers. (Higher level UOs automatically includes lower level UOs in them). If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities  which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for  each  activity).  For micro project  report  should  be  as  per suggested format, for other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos of  the  activities  for  their  (student's)  portfolio  which  will  be  useful  for  their  placement interviews:

- a) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- b) Prepare charts for various models, SDLC life cycles, UML notations etc.
- c) Prepare SRS documents based on case study.
- d) Discuss various case studies available on internet.
- e) An  hour  of  problem  solving  for  various  case  study  topics  may  be  organized  and students are encouraged to participate

- f) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.
- g) Encourage  students  to  interact  with  the  industry  person  to  discuss  and  gather information  of  current  trends,  models,  documentation,  testing  methods  and  different tools used in industry.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES

These  are  sample  strategies,  which  the  teacher  can  use  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive  open  online  courses  ( MOOCs )  may  be  used  to  teach  various  topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) Managing Learning Environment
- d) Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help for students.
- e) Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the course material at his or her pace.
- f) Encourage students  to  do  Group  learning  by  sharing  so  that  teaching  can  easily  be enhanced.
- g) 'CI'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- h) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using  different assessment methods.
- i) With  respect  to section  No.10 ,  teachers  need  to  ensure  to  create  opportunities  and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- j) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her  in  the  beginning  of  the  semester.  In  the  first  four  semesters,  the  micro-project  are group-based (group of 3 to  5).  However, in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters ,  the  number  of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total work load on each student due to   the microproject  should  be  about 16  (sixteen)  student  engagement  hours (i.e.,  about  one  hour  per week)  during  the  course.  The  students  ought  to  submit  micro-project  by  the  end  of  the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A  suggestive  list  of  micro-projects  is  given  here.  This  should  relate  highly  with competency  of  the  course  and  the  COs.  Similar  micro-projects  could  be  added  by  the concerned course teacher:

- a) Case study on attendance management system
- b) Case study on vehicle rental system
- c) Case study on hospital appointment booking
- d) Case study on gym management system
- e) Case study on Tours and Travel Management
- f) Case study on hostel management system

- g) Case study on student management system
- h) Case study on library management system
- i) Case study on hospital management system
- j) Case study on banking system
- k) Case study on collage management system
- l) Case study on movie ticket booking system
- m) Case study on online food ordering application
- n) Case study on online shopping
- o) Case study on hotel management system
- p) Case study on bus ticket reservation system
- q) Case study on railway ticket reservation system
- r) Case study on flight ticket reservation system
