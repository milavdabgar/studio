## Question 1(c OR) [7 marks]

**Explain MD5 hashing algorithm.**

**Answer**:
MD5 (Message Digest 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value:

1. **Input Processing**: Message is padded and divided into 512-bit blocks
2. **Initialization**: Sets up four 32-bit registers with fixed values
3. **Compression**: Processes message in 16-word blocks through four rounds of operations
4. **Output**: Produces 128-bit digest as final hash value

**Diagram:**

```mermaid

    A[Input Message] --> B[Padding]
    B --> C[Divide into Blocks]
    C --> D[Process Blocks]
    D --> E[Four Processing Rounds]
    E --> F[128-bit Output Hash]
```

- **Weakness**: Not collision-resistant; shouldn't be used for security-critical applications
- **Usage**: File integrity verification and non-security critical applications

**Mnemonic:** "Pad, Divide, Process, Output - Don't Use For Security!"

## Question 2(a) [3 marks]

**Define authentication in context of cyber security.**

**Answer**:
Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity before granting access to resources:

- **Confirms**: "You are who you claim to be"
- **Verifies**: Identity using credentials (passwords, biometrics, tokens)
- **Precedes**: Authorization (what you can access after authentication)

**Mnemonic:** "Verify Before Entry"

## Question 2(b) [4 marks]

**Explain public key cryptography with example.**

**Answer**:
Public key cryptography uses two mathematically related keys for secure communication:

| Component | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Public Key** | Shared openly and used to encrypt messages |
| **Private Key** | Kept secret and used to decrypt messages |

**Example**: In RSA encryption, if Alice wants to send Bob a message:

1. Alice encrypts with Bob's public key
2. Only Bob can decrypt using his private key

**Diagram:**
