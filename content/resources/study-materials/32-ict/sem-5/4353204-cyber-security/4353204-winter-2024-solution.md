## Question 1(c OR) [7 marks]

**Explain MD5 hashing algorithm.**

**Answer**:
MD5 (Message Digest 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value:

1. **Input Processing**: Message is padded and divided into 512-bit blocks
2. **Initialization**: Sets up four 32-bit registers with fixed values
3. **Compression**: Processes message in 16-word blocks through four rounds of operations
4. **Output**: Produces 128-bit digest as final hash value

**Diagram:**
