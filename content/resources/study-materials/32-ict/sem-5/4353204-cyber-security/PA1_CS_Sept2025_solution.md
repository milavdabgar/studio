## Question 2: Answer the following questions [10 Marks]

### Question 2(a) [7 marks]

**Explain working of packet filter and application proxy.**

**Answer**:

| Firewall Type | Working |
|---------------|---------|
| **Packet Filter** | Examines packet headers based on predefined rules. Makes decisions based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols. Works at OSI network and transport layers. Offers high-speed filtering with low resource usage. |
| **Application Proxy** | Acts as intermediary between client and server applications. Processes all traffic at application layer. Creates two connections (client-to-proxy and proxy-to-server). Provides content inspection and user authentication capabilities. |

**Diagram:**

**Key Differences:**

| Feature | Packet Filter | Application Proxy |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Speed** | Fast | Slower |
| **Security** | Basic | Advanced |
| **Resource Usage** | Low | High |
| **Content Inspection** | Header only | Full content |

**Mnemonic**: "Packets Check Headers, Proxies Check Content"

### Question 2(b) [3 marks]

**What is authentication? Explain different methods of authentication.**

**Answer**:

**Authentication Definition:**
Process of verifying user identity before granting system access.

**Authentication Methods:**

![Authentication Methods](diagrams/authentication-methods.svg)

| Method | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Password** | Something you know | PIN, passphrase |
| **Biometric** | Something you are | Fingerprint, iris |
| **Token** | Something you have | Smart card, USB key |

- **Single-Factor**: Uses one authentication method
- **Multi-Factor**: Combines multiple methods
- **Two-Factor (2FA)**: Uses exactly two factors

**Mnemonic**: "Password Biometric Token Authentication"

## Alternative Set Questions

### Alternative Q1: Answer the following questions [10 Marks]

#### Alternative Q1(a) [7 marks]

**Explain MD5 hashing and Secure Hash Function (SHA) algorithms.**

**Answer**:

**Hash Function Comparison:**

![Hash Function Process](diagrams/hash-function-process.svg)

| Feature | MD5 | SHA-1 | SHA-256 |
|---------|-----|-------|---------|
| **Output Size** | 128 bits | 160 bits | 256 bits |
| **Security Level** | Weak | Weak | Strong |
| **Speed** | Fast | Moderate | Slower |
| **Current Status** | Deprecated | Deprecated | Recommended |

**MD5 Algorithm Process:**

1. **Input Processing**: Message is padded and divided into 512-bit blocks
2. **Initialization**: Sets up four 32-bit registers with fixed values
3. **Compression**: Processes message in 16-word blocks through four rounds of operations
4. **Output**: Produces 128-bit digest as final hash value

**SHA Algorithm Features:**

- **Deterministic**: Same input produces same hash
- **Avalanche Effect**: Small input change causes major hash change
- **One-way Function**: Cannot reverse hash to original data
- **Collision Resistant**: Difficult to find two inputs with same hash

**Applications:**

- Password storage and verification
- Digital signatures and certificates
- Data integrity verification

**Mnemonic**: "Hash Always Produces Same Output"

#### Alternative Q1(b) [3 marks]

**Explain Public key and Private Key cryptography.**

**Answer**:

**Public Key Cryptography (Asymmetric):**

![Public Key Cryptography](diagrams/public-key-cryptography.svg)

**Key Characteristics:**

| Feature | Public Key | Private Key |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Distribution** | Freely shared | Kept secret |
| **Usage** | Encryption/Verification | Decryption/Signing |
| **Security** | Can be public | Must be protected |

- **Public Key**: Used for encryption and signature verification
- **Private Key**: Used for decryption and digital signing
- **Security**: Based on mathematical complexity (RSA, ECC algorithms)

**Example**: In RSA encryption, if Alice wants to send Bob a message:

1. Alice encrypts with Bob's public key
2. Only Bob can decrypt using his private key

**Mnemonic**: "Public Encrypts, Private Decrypts"

### Alternative Q2: Answer the following questions [10 Marks]
