<!--
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework provides a comprehensive structure for organizations to manage cybersecurity risks effectively.

[click] The framework was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology as a voluntary guidance document for organizations.

[click] It's designed to be industry-agnostic, meaning it can be applied across all sectors and organization sizes, from small businesses to large enterprises.

[click] The framework takes a risk-based approach, focusing on business risk management rather than just technical security controls.

[click] Its flexible implementation allows organizations to adapt the framework to their existing security programs and organizational structures.

[click] The framework promotes continuous improvement through iterative enhancement processes and regular assessment.

[click] The framework consists of five core functions that provide a high-level strategic view of the lifecycle of cybersecurity risk management.

[click] The Identify function helps organizations understand their business context, resources, and related cybersecurity risks.

[click] The Protect function outlines appropriate safeguards to ensure delivery of critical infrastructure services.

[click] The Detect function defines appropriate activities to identify the occurrence of cybersecurity events.

[click] The Respond function includes appropriate activities to take action regarding detected cybersecurity incidents.

[click] The Recover function identifies appropriate activities to maintain plans for resilience and to restore capabilities impaired by cybersecurity incidents.

[click] Within the Identify function, key activities include creating comprehensive asset inventories, conducting thorough risk assessments, establishing governance policies, mapping business environments, and managing supply chain risks.

[click] The Protect function encompasses access control implementation, security awareness training, data security measures, information protection processes, maintenance procedures, and protective technology deployment.

[click] Detection activities involve continuous monitoring systems, anomaly detection capabilities, security event analysis, detection process improvement, and threat intelligence integration.

[click] Response activities include comprehensive response planning, clear communication protocols, analysis and mitigation procedures, improvement integration, and effective stakeholder coordination.

[click] Recovery activities focus on recovery planning, improvement implementation, communication during recovery periods, business continuity maintenance, and integration of lessons learned from incidents.
