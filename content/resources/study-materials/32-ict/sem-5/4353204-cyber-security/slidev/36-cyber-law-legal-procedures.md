## ‚öñÔ∏è What is Cyber Law?

**Cyber law** encompasses all legal and regulatory aspects of internet and digital technology use, including privacy, data protection, cybercrime, and digital rights.

### üìä Cyber Law Statistics (2024)
- **Global cybercrime costs**: $10.5 trillion annually
- **Cybercrime laws**: 189+ countries have legislation
- **Prosecution rate**: Only 0.05% of cybercriminals prosecuted
- **Cross-border cases**: 78% require international cooperation
- **Evidence admissibility**: 65% of digital evidence accepted
- **Legal expertise gap**: 90% of law enforcement needs training

### ‚öñÔ∏è Balancing Security and Privacy
```yaml
Legal Balancing Tests:
  Proportionality Analysis:
    - Legitimate aim identification
    - Necessity assessment
    - Adequate relation evaluation
    - Less restrictive alternatives
    - Balance of interests

  Four-fold Test (Puttaswamy):
    1. Legality: Law must exist
    2. Legitimate goal: Must serve valid state interest
    3. Proportionality: Rational nexus required
    4. Procedural guarantees: Safeguards necessary

  Surveillance Safeguards:
    - Independent oversight mechanisms
    - Judicial review requirements
    - Time limitations on orders
    - Data minimization principles
    - Regular compliance audits

  International Standards:
    - European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence
    - UN Special Rapporteur guidelines
    - Democratic oversight principles
    - Transparency reporting requirements
    - International cooperation frameworks
