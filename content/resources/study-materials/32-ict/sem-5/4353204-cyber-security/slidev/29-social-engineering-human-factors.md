- **Success rate**: 95% of successful breaches
- **Average cost**: $4.9 million per incident
- **Phishing emails**: 3.4 billion sent daily
- **Click rate**: 32% of users click phishing links
- **Credential harvest**: 76% success rate

### 🎭 Core Principles
```yaml
Psychological Triggers:
  - Authority and urgency
  - Trust and reciprocity  
  - Fear and intimidation
  - Curiosity and greed
  - Social proof and compliance
```

</div>
