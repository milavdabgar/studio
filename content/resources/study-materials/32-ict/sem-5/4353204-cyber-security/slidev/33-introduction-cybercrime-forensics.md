    with open(file_path, 'rb') as f:
        for chunk in iter(lambda: f.read(4096), b""):
            hasher.update(chunk)
    
    return hasher.hexdigest()

# Evidence verification example
def verify_evidence_integrity(original_hash, current_file):
    """Verify evidence hasn't been tampered with"""
    current_hash = calculate_file_hash(current_file)
    
    if original_hash == current_hash:
        return "Evidence integrity verified"
    else:
        return "WARNING: Evidence may have been tampered with"

# Usage
evidence_file = "/evidence/hard_drive_image.dd"
original_hash = "a1b2c3d4e5f6789..."
