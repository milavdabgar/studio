# Risk: Understanding and Managing Uncertainty

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

## ⚡ Definition
**Risk** is the potential for loss or damage when a threat exploits a vulnerability. It represents the likelihood and impact of adverse events.

## 🧮 Risk Formula
```
Risk = Threat × Vulnerability × Impact
```

### Risk Components
- **Threat** - Source of potential harm
- **Vulnerability** - Weakness that can be exploited
- **Impact** - Potential consequences
- **Likelihood** - Probability of occurrence

## 📊 Risk Assessment Process
1. **Asset identification** - What needs protection?
2. **Threat identification** - What can cause harm?
3. **Vulnerability assessment** - Where are weaknesses?
4. **Impact analysis** - What are consequences?
5. **Risk calculation** - Quantify the risk
6. **Risk treatment** - How to respond?

</div>

<div>

## 🎯 Risk Management Strategies

### 1. Risk Avoidance
- **Eliminate** the risk entirely
- **Don't engage** in risky activities
- **Example:** Not connecting critical systems to internet

### 2. Risk Mitigation  
- **Reduce** likelihood or impact
- **Implement** security controls
- **Example:** Install firewalls and antivirus

### 3. Risk Transfer
- **Shift** risk to another party
- **Insurance** or outsourcing
- **Example:** Cyber insurance policies

### 4. Risk Acceptance
- **Accept** the risk as-is
- **Cost of control** > value protected
- **Example:** Legacy system with low value

## 📈 Risk Appetite vs Risk Tolerance
- **Risk Appetite** - Desired risk level
- **Risk Tolerance** - Maximum acceptable risk
- **Risk Capacity** - Ability to absorb risk
