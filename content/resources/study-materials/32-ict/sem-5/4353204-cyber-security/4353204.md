## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro project report should be as per suggested format, for other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- **a)** Provide students with real-world case studies of cyber attacks and have them analyze the incidents, identify vulnerabilities exploited, and suggest mitigation strategies.
- **b)** Organize competitions where students can practice ethical hacking skills and solve security challenges.
- **c)** Develop and conduct an awareness campaign on cybersecurity best practices for the campus community, including creating informative posters, videos, and presentations.
- **d)** Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edX, Coursera, Udemy etc. to further enhance their learning.
- **e)** Undertake micro-projects to develop simple security tools, such as password generators, encryption/decryption programs, or network monitoring tools.
- **f)** Organize guest lectures and workshops with industry professionals to provide insights into the latest trends, challenges, and technologies in cybersecurity.
- **g)** Conduct security audits of the institute's IT infrastructure under supervision, identifying potential vulnerabilities and suggesting improvements.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- **a)** Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- **b)** Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- **c)** Managing Learning Environment
- **d)** Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help for students.
- **e)** Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the course material at his or her pace.
- **f)** Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be enhanced.
- **g)** 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- **h)** About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- **i)** With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- **j)** Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total work load on each student due to the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- **a)** Create a script that configures basic firewall rules using iptables to block or allow specific types of network traffic.
- **b)** Develop a Python-based web application that incorporates password-based authentication and an additional factor like OTP (One-Time Password) or biometric authentication.
- **c)** Write a Python program using libraries like Scapy to capture and analyze network packets for monitoring network traffic.
- **d)** Develop a simulation that demonstrates a basic DoS attack on a server and implement measures to detect and mitigate such attacks.
- **e)** Develop a Python program that monitors system logs and network traffic for suspicious activities and generates alerts.
- **f)** Create a tool that scans web applications for common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), and weak authentication mechanisms.
- **g)** Implement a Python program that uses the paramiko library to securely transfer files between a client and server using the SSH protocol.
- **h)** Write a script to set up and configure a secure VPN server using OpenVPN, and demonstrate secure remote access to a network.
- **i)** Create a Python program that generates digital signatures for documents and verifies their authenticity using public key infrastructure (PKI).
