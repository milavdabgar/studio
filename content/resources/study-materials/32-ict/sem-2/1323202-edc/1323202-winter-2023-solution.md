## Question 5(b) [4 marks]

**Give the difference between Fixed voltage regulator IC and Variable voltage regulator IC.**

**Answer**:
Voltage regulator ICs differ in their configurability and application requirements.

**Table:**

| Parameter | Fixed Voltage Regulator | Variable Voltage Regulator |
|-----------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| Output voltage | Predetermined (e.g., 5V, 12V) | Adjustable over a range |
| External components | Minimal (capacitors only) | Requires resistors for setting |
| Series | 78xx (positive), 79xx (negative) | LM317 (positive), LM337 (negative) |
| Applications | Standard equipment | Custom designs, laboratory supplies |
| Flexibility | Limited to fixed values | Highly adaptable |
| Pin count | Typically 3 pins | 3 or more pins |

- **Fixed regulators**: Simple to use, limited adjustment
- **Variable regulators**: More versatile, require calculation
