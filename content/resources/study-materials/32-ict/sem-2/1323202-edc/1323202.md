## 1. Rationale

Electrical, Electronic and communication, Information and communication technology and
allied engineering diploma holders are required to use and maintain various types of
electronically controlled equipment. The fundamental principles of electronics are to be
applied in most of the situations to arrive at the probable solutions which is faced in the world
of work, therefore the knowledge of the functions of various basic electronic devices and
components and practical skills acquired through the laboratory experiments will help them,
when they work with electronic equipment and its sub-circuits. This course is designed to
develop the skills to use the basics electronic devices and apply the knowledge to maintain
the various types of electronic circuits.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:

To maintain various electronic circuits and it’s applications.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills
associated with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the
achievement of the following COs:

- Use electronic devices for various applications
- Test different amplifiers and oscillators.
- Use different Thyristors for various applications.
- Use integrated circuits for various applications
- Build Regulated Power Supply for Green Technology

*(*): For this practical only course, 25 marks under the practical CA have two components i.e. the*

assessment of micro-project, which will be done out of 10 marks and the remaining 15 marks are
for the assessment of practical. This is designed to facilitate attainment of COs holistically, as
there is no theory ESE.

Study report, data collection and analysis report must be assigned in a group. Teacher has
to discuss about type of data (which and why) before group start their market survey.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.

-         Work as a leader/a team member.
-         Follow ethical practices.
-        Practice environment friendly methods and processes.
-        Follow safety precautions.
The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
          ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
          iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised
Bloom’s taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If
required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment
of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of
the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group
and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record
physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement
interviews:

-     Prepare a table and interpret the technical specification of various transistors
and thyristors using data sheets.

ii.         Compare specifications of various voltage regulator ICs.

iii.   Prepare a survey report of different heat sinks used in electronic
devices/instruments and list out the alternatives used for heat sinks.

iv.   Undertake a market survey of Different types of Amplifiers and oscillators
modules.

-        Prepare labeled charts of SMPS

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of
the various outcomes in this course:

- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students to find different ICs used in real time application based on diodes
,transistors and thyristors.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be
assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the
micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth
semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give
a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should
be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course.
The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the
industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and
the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Transistor Amplifier: a common emitter amplifier using transistor and prepare
           a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Op-Amp: Build any application of op-Amp(IC-741) and prepare a mini project
- Oscillator: Build any basic oscillator circuit and prepare a mini project report.
- Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Power control : Build any application of AC powr control using TRIAC
- Power control : Build any application of DC powr control using SCR
- Timer IC 555: Build any circuit using timer IC 555 and prepare a mini project
           report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Battery Chargers: Build a mobile/USB battery charger using solar cell.
- Voltage regulator : Build variable voltage regulator using LM317
