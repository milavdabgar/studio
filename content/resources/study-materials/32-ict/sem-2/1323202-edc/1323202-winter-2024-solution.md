- **Practical Issue**: High noise sensitivity
- **Modification**: Small resistor in series with C to limit high-frequency gain
- **Applications**: Waveshaping, rate-of-change detection

**Mnemonic:** "Rate of Change Goes In, Amplitude Comes Out"

## Question 5(c OR) [7 marks]

**Draw and explain the circuit diagram of -12 V regulated dc power supply.**

**Answer**:
A -12V regulated supply provides stable negative voltage for analog circuits.

**Circuit Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    AC((AC Input)) --- TRANS[Transformer]
    TRANS --- D1[D1]
    D1 --- D2[D2]
    D2 --- C1[Filter Cap]
    C1 --- IC[7912 IC]
    IC --- C2[0.1µF]
    C2 --- OUT((\-12V Output))
    C1 --- GND((GND))
    IC --- GND
    C2 --- GND
    D3[D3] --- D4[D4]
    D3 --- TRANS
    D4 --- C1
```

- **Working Principle**: Full-wave rectifier creates negative voltage
- **Components**: Transformer, bridge rectifier, filter capacitors, 7912 regulator
- **Regulator IC**: 7912 provides fixed -12V output with internal protection
- **Filter Capacitors**: Input capacitor filters ripple, output capacitor improves transient response
- **Applications**: Op-amp negative rail, analog circuits, audio equipment

**Mnemonic:** "Full Bridge, Big Capacitor, 7912 Regulates Negative"
