Semester:                         2nd
Category of the Course:           PCC

Prerequisite:     Basic computer skills
Rationale:        Programming skills using Python Language have become prevalent and
increasingly popular in the Information Technology domain. The Python
programming language is one of the most popular programming languages
worldwide. The Python Programming for Information Communication Technology
- ICT) course emphasizes the use of this popular programming platform in multiple
domains. Python is a modern language for writing compact codes specifically for
programming Server-side web apps, Data Analytics and Machine Learning, an
important Artificial Intelligence domain. Furthermore, Python has gained
popularity in scientific computing, production tools and game programming. The
following course focuses on developing Python Programs for programming tasks
where the students are encouraged to create basic applications using different open
source tools. At the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic
programming skills using python language.

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:
- BT Level

Suggested Project List:
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned tohim/her
in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based.
However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build

up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the
projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the
number of students in the group should not exceed three. The micro-project could be industry
application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-

  project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs.
  Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the
  project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-
  project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student
  ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.
          A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency andthe COs.
 Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Case Study 1: Compare three various tools functionality for python programming in the
- CT domain
- Case Study 2: List out features of latest python version and compare with older two
          different versions.
- Case Study 3: Study math and random module of python and explain real life usage with
          examples. List their importance in Information Communication Technology
