## Prerequisite

Basic computer skills

## Rationale

Programming skills using Python Language have become prevalent and increasingly popular in the Information Technology domain. The Python programming language is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. The Python Programming for Information Communication Technology (ICT) course emphasizes the use of this popular programming platform in multiple domains. Python is a modern language for writing compact codes specifically for programming Server-side web apps, Data Analytics and Machine Learning, an important Artificial Intelligence domain. Furthermore, Python has gained popularity in scientific computing, production tools and game programming. The following course focuses on developing Python Programs for programming tasks where the students are encouraged to create basic applications using different open source tools. At the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic programming skills using python language.

## Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

## Suggested Project List

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three. The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- **Case Study 1:** Compare three various tools functionality for python programming in the ICT domain
- **Case Study 2:** List out features of latest python version and compare with older two different versions.
- **Case Study 3:** Study math and random module of python and explain real life usage with examples. List their importance in Information Communication Technology
