Prerequisite:

Basic computer skills

Rationale:

Programming skills using Python Language have become prevalent and increasingly popular in the Information Technology domain. The Python programming  language  is  one  of  the  most  popular  programming  languages worldwide. The Python Programming for Information Communication Technology (ICT) course emphasizes the use of this popular programming platform in multiple domains. Python is a modern language for writing compact codes specifically for programming  Server-side  web  apps,  Data  Analytics  and  Machine  Learning,  an important Artificial Intelligence domain. Furthermore, Python has gained popularity in scientific computing, production tools and game programming. The following course focuses on developing Python Programs for programming tasks where the students are encouraged to create basic applications using different open source tools. At the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic programming skills using python language.

## Course Outcome:

After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

## Underpinning Theory

Only  the  major  Underpinning  Theory  is  formulated  as  higher-level  UOs  of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students  and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher  to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

## Suggested Project List:

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to  him/her in  the  beginning  of  the  semester.  In  the  first  four  semesters,  the  micro-project  are  group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build

Course / Subject Name  : Python Programming up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so  that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have  to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three. The  micro-project could be industry application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each microproject should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give  a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the microproject should  not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought  to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and  the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Case Study 1: Compare three various tools functionality for python programming in  the ICT domain
- Case Study 2: List out features of latest python version and compare with older two different versions.
- Case Study 3: Study math and random module of python and explain real life usage  with examples. List their importance in Information Communication Technology
