  "rationale": "Programming skills using Python Language have become prevalent and increasingly popular in the Information Technology domain. The Python programming language is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. The Python Programming for Information Communication Technology (ICT) course emphasizes the use of this popular programming platform in multiple domains. Python is a modern language for writing compact codes specifically for programming Server-side web apps, Data Analytics and Machine Learning, an important Artificial Intelligence domain. Furthermore, Python has gained popularity in scientific computing, production tools and game programming. The following course focuses on developing Python Programs for programming tasks where the students are encouraged to create basic applications using different open source tools. At the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic programming skills using python language.",
