Diploma programme in which this course is offered           Semester in which offered
Information Communication Technology                           Second

## 1. Rationale

Programming skills using Python Language have become prevalent and increasingly popular
in the Information Technology domain. The Python programming language is one of the most
popular programming languages worldwide. The Python Programming for Information
Communication Technology (ICT) course emphasizes the use of this popular programming
platform in multiple domains. Python is a modern language for writing compact codes
specifically for programming Server-side web apps, Data Analytics and Machine Learning, an
important Artificial Intelligence domain. Furthermore, Python has gained popularity in
scientific computing, production tools and game programming.

The following course focuses on developing Python Programs for programming tasks where
the students are encouraged to create basic applications using different open source tools. At
the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic programming skills using
python language.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to enable the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching-learning experiences:
- Develop Programs using Python to solve well-defined Problems.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge, and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

The student will develop underpinning knowledge, adequate programming skills of
competency for implementing various applications using python to attain the following course
outcomes.

- Prepare flowchart and algorithm for solving computing problems.
- Develop python programs to solve simple problems.
- Apply control structure feature of python for developing programs.
- Develop Python Programs using built-in functions, modules and libraries.

Python Programming                                                              Course Code: 1323203

- Develop python programs using dictionary, list, string, set and tuple manipulation
functions.

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.

- Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level
of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should
gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 9. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students
and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher
to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different
taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.
## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare
reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their
(student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.

- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for open source python editors.

- 3. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so
that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have
to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
 maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give
 a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should
 not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought
 to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.
         A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and
the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Case Study 1: Compare three various tools functionality for python programming in
         the ICT domain
- Case Study 2: List out features of latest python version and compare with older two
         different versions.
- Case Study 3: Study math and random module of python and explain real life usage
         with examples. List their importance in Information Communication Technology
