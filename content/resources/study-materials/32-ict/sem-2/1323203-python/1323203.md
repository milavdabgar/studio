## 1. RATIONALE

Programming skills using Python Language have become prevalent and increasingly popular in the Information Technology domain. The Python programming language is one of the most popular  programming  languages  worldwide.  The  Python  Programming  for  Information Communication Technology (ICT) course emphasizes the use of this popular programming platform  in  multiple  domains.  Python  is  a  modern  language  for  writing  compact  codes specifically for programming Server-side web apps, Data Analytics and Machine Learning, an important  Artificial  Intelligence  domain.  Furthermore,  Python  has  gained  popularity  in scientific computing, production tools and game programming.

The following course focuses on developing Python Programs for programming tasks where the students are encouraged to create basic applications using different open source tools. At the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic programming skills using python language.

## 2. COMPETENCY

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.

- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of  achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year

## 9. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only  the  major  Underpinning  Theory  is  formulated  as  higher-level  UOs  of Revised  Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly  from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports  of  about  5  pages  for  each  activity,  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.

- e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- f) Guide students for open source python editors.

## 13. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Case Study 1: Compare three various tools functionality for python programming in the ICT domain
- Case Study 2: List out features of latest python version and compare with older two different versions.
- Case Study 3: Study math and random module of python and explain real life usage with examples. List their importance in Information Communication Technology
