## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Define linear data structure and give its examples.**

**Answer**:
A linear data structure is a collection of elements arranged in sequential order where each element has exactly one predecessor and one successor (except first and last elements).

**Table: Linear Data Structures Examples**

| Data Structure | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| Array | Fixed-size collection of elements accessed by index |
| Linked List | Chain of nodes with data and reference to next node |
| Stack | LIFO (Last In First Out) structure |
| Queue | FIFO (First In First Out) structure |

**Mnemonic:** "ALSQ are in a Line"

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Define time and space complexity.**

**Answer**:
Time and space complexity measure algorithm efficiency in terms of execution time and memory usage as input size grows.

**Table: Complexity Comparison**

| Complexity Type | Definition | Measurement | Importance |
|----------------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Time Complexity | Measures execution time required by an algorithm as a function of input size | Big O notation (O(n), O(1), O(n²)) | Determines how fast an algorithm runs |
| Space Complexity | Measures memory space required by an algorithm as a function of input size | Big O notation (O(n), O(1), O(n²)) | Determines how much memory an algorithm needs |

**Mnemonic:** "TS: Time-Speed and Space-Storage"

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

**Explain the concept of class and object with example.**

**Answer**:
Classes and objects are fundamental OOP concepts where classes are blueprints for creating objects with attributes and behaviors.

**Diagram: Class and Object Relationship**

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Student {
        +name: string
        +rollNo: int
        +marks: float
        +displayInfo()
    }
    Student <|-- StudentObject: Creates
```

**Code Example:**

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, rollNo, marks):
        self.name = name
        self.rollNo = rollNo
        self.marks = marks
    
    def displayInfo(self):
        print(f"Name: {self.name}, Roll No: {self.rollNo}, Marks: {self.marks}")

# Creating object
student1 = Student("Raj", 101, 85.5)
student1.displayInfo()
```

- **Class**: Blueprint defining attributes (name, rollNo, marks) and methods (displayInfo)
- **Object**: Instance (student1) created from the class with specific values

**Mnemonic:** "CAR - Class defines Attributes and Routines"

## Question 1(c) OR [7 marks]

**Explain instance method, class method and static method with example.**

**Answer**:
Python supports three method types: instance, class, and static methods, each serving different purposes.

**Table: Comparison of Method Types**

| Method Type | Decorator | First Parameter | Purpose | Access |
|-------------|-----------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| Instance Method | None | self | Operate on instance data | Can access/modify instance state |
| Class Method | @classmethod | cls | Operate on class data | Can access/modify class state |
| Static Method | @staticmethod | None | Utility functions | Cannot access instance or class state |

**Code Example:**

```python
class Student:
    school = "ABC School"  # class variable
    
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # instance variable
    
    def instance_method(self):  # instance method
        return f"Hi {self.name} from {self.school}"
    
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls):  # class method
        return f"School is {cls.school}"
    
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():  # static method
        return "This is a utility function"
```

**Mnemonic:** "ICS: Instance-Self, Class-Cls, Static-Solo"

## Question 2(a) [3 marks]

**Explain concept of recursive function.**

**Answer**:
A recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution to solve smaller instances of the same problem.

**Diagram: Recursive Function Execution**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["factorial(3)"] --> B["factorial(2)"]
    B --> C["factorial(1)"]
    C --> D[Return 1]
    D --> E[Return 1*2=2]
    E --> F[Return 2*3=6]
```

**Mnemonic:** "BASE and RECURSE - Base case stops, Recursion repeats"

## Question 2(b) [4 marks]

**Define stack and queue.**

**Answer**:
Stack and queue are linear data structures with different access patterns for data insertion and removal.

**Table: Stack vs Queue**

| Feature | Stack | Queue |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Access Pattern | LIFO (Last In First Out) | FIFO (First In First Out) |
| Operations | Push (insert), Pop (remove) | Enqueue (insert), Dequeue (remove) |
| Access Points | Single end (top) | Two ends (front, rear) |
| Visualization | Like plates stacked vertically | Like people in a line |
| Applications | Function calls, undo operations | Print jobs, process scheduling |

**Mnemonic:** "SLIFF vs QFIFF - Stack-LIFO vs Queue-FIFO"

## Question 2(c) [7 marks]

**Explain basic operations on stack.**

**Answer**:
Stack operations follow LIFO (Last In First Out) principle with the following basic operations:

**Table: Stack Operations**

| Operation | Description | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Push | Insert element at the top | O(1) |
| Pop | Remove element from the top | O(1) |
| Peek/Top | View top element without removing | O(1) |
| isEmpty | Check if stack is empty | O(1) |
| isFull | Check if stack is full (for array implementation) | O(1) |

**Diagram: Stack Operations**

```goat
       +---+    Push
       | 8 | <-------
Top -> +---+
       | 5 |    Pop
       +---+ -------->
       | 3 |
       +---+
       | 1 |
       +---+
```

**Code Example:**

```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def pop(self):
        if not self.isEmpty():
            return self.items.pop()
    
    def peek(self):
        if not self.isEmpty():
            return self.items[-1]
    
    def isEmpty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0
```

**Mnemonic:** "PIPES - Push In, Pop Exit, See top"

Enqueue and Dequeue are the primary operations for adding and removing elements in a queue data structure.

**Table: Queue Operations**

| Operation | Description | Implementation | Time Complexity |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Enqueue | Add element at the rear end | queue.append(element) | O(1) |
| Dequeue | Remove element from the front end | element = queue.pop(0) | O(1) with linked list, O(n) with array |

**Diagram: Queue Operations**

```goat
      Enqueue                         Dequeue
     -------->                       --------->

## Question 3(c) OR [7 marks]

**Explain deletion of first and last node in singly linked list.**

**Answer**:
Deleting nodes from a singly linked list varies in complexity based on the position (first vs. last).

**Table: Deletion Comparison**

| Position | Approach | Time Complexity | Special Case |
|----------|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| First Node | Change head pointer | O(1) | Check if list is empty |
| Last Node | Traverse to second-last node | O(n) | Handle single node list |

**Code Example:**

```python
def delete_first(self):
    # Check if list is empty
    if self.head is None:
        return
    
    # Update head to second node
    self.head = self.head.next

def delete_last(self):
    # Check if list is empty
    if self.head is None:
        return
    
    # If only one node
    if self.head.next is None:
        self.head = None
        return
    
    # Traverse to second last node
    current = self.head
    while current.next.next:
        current = current.next
    
    # Remove last node
    current.next = None
```

    left = 0
    right = len(arr) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        # Check if target is present at mid
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        
        # If target is greater, ignore left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        
        # If target is smaller, ignore right half
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    # Target not found
    return -1
```

## Question 4(c) OR [7 marks]

**Explain the working of quick sort method with example.**

**Answer**:
Quick sort is an efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element and partitioning the array.

**Table: Quick Sort Steps**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Choose a pivot element from the array |
| 2 | Partition: Rearrange elements (smaller than pivot to left, larger to right) |
| 3 | Recursively apply quick sort to subarrays on left and right of pivot |

**Example with Array [7, 2, 1, 6, 8, 5, 3, 4]**:

```
Pivot: 4
After partition: [2, 1, 3] 4 [7, 6, 8, 5]
                 Left      P  Right

Recursively sort left: [1] 2 [3] → [1, 2, 3]
Recursively sort right: [5] 7 [6, 8] → [5, 6, 7, 8]

Final sorted array: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

**Diagram: Quick Sort Partitioning**

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Array: 7,2,1,6,8,5,3,4] --> B[Choose Pivot: 4]
    B --> C[Partition]
    C --> D[Left: 2,1,3]
    C --> E[Pivot: 4]
    C --> F[Right: 7,6,8,5]
    D --> G[Recursively Sort Left]
    F --> H[Recursively Sort Right]
    G --> I[Sorted Left: 1,2,3]
    H --> J[Sorted Right: 5,6,7,8]
    I --> K[Final: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

## Question 5(c) [7 marks]

**Apply preorder and postorder traversal for given below tree.**

**Answer**:
Preorder and postorder are depth-first tree traversal methods with different node visiting sequences.

**Given Tree:**

```goat
        40
       /  \
     30    50
    / \    / \
   25 35  45  60
  / \        / \
 15  28     55  70
```

**Table: Tree Traversal Comparison**

| Traversal | Order | Result for Given Tree |
|-----------|-------|------------------------|
| Preorder | Root, Left, Right | 40, 30, 25, 15, 28, 35, 50, 45, 60, 55, 70 |
| Postorder | Left, Right, Root | 15, 28, 25, 35, 30, 45, 55, 70, 60, 50, 40 |

**Code Example:**

```python
def preorder(root):
    if root:
        print(root.data, end=", ")  # Visit root
        preorder(root.left)         # Visit left subtree
        preorder(root.right)        # Visit right subtree

def postorder(root):
    if root:
        postorder(root.left)        # Visit left subtree
        postorder(root.right)       # Visit right subtree
        print(root.data, end=", ")  # Visit root
```

| Expression Trees | Representing mathematical expressions for evaluation |
| Huffman Coding | Data compression algorithms |
| Priority Queues | Implementation of heap data structure |
| Decision Trees | Classification algorithms in machine learning |

**Mnemonic:** "BEHPD - BST, Expression, Huffman, Priority queue, Decision tree"

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Explain insertion of a node in binary search tree.**

**Answer**:
Insertion in a Binary Search Tree (BST) follows the BST property: left child < parent < right child.

**Table: Insertion Steps in BST**

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Start at the root node |
| 2 | If new value < current node value, go to left subtree |
| 3 | If new value > current node value, go to right subtree |
| 4 | Repeat until finding an empty position (null pointer) |
| 5 | Insert the new node at the empty position found |

**Diagram: BST Insertion**

    A[Start at Root] --> B{New Value < Current?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Move to Left Child]
    B -- No --> D[Move to Right Child]
    C --> E{Left Child Exists?}
    D --> F{Right Child Exists?}
    E -- Yes --> B
    E -- No --> G[Insert as Left Child]
    F -- Yes --> B
    F -- No --> H[Insert as Right Child]
```

## Question 5(c) OR [7 marks]

**Draw Binary search tree for 8, 4, 12, 2, 6, 10, 14, 1, 3, 5 and write In-order traversal for the tree.**

**Answer**:
Binary Search Tree (BST) is constructed by inserting nodes while maintaining the BST property.

**Binary Search Tree for the given elements:**

```goat
        8
       / \
      4   12
     / \  / \
    2   6 10 14
   / \  /
  1   3 5
```

**Table: BST Construction Process**

| Step | Insert | Tree Structure |
|------|--------|----------------|
| 1 | 8 | Root = 8 |
| 2 | 4 | Left of 8 |
| 3 | 12 | Right of 8 |
| 4 | 2 | Left of 4 |
| 5 | 6 | Right of 4 |
| 6 | 10 | Left of 12 |
| 7 | 14 | Right of 12 |
| 8 | 1 | Left of 2 |
| 9 | 3 | Right of 2 |
| 10 | 5 | Left of 6 |

**In-order Traversal:**

An in-order traversal visits nodes in the order: left subtree, current node, right subtree.

For the given BST, the in-order traversal is:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14

**Code Example:**

```python
def inorder_traversal(root):
    if root:
        inorder_traversal(root.left)    # Visit left subtree
        print(root.data, end=", ")      # Visit current node
        inorder_traversal(root.right)   # Visit right subtree
```

**Mnemonic:** "LNR - Left, Node, Right makes sorted order in BST"
