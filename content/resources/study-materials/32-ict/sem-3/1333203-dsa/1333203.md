## 1. RATIONALE

Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture of machines efficiently and  effectively  requires  the  ability  to  use  and  manipulate  various  types  of  Data  Structures  and  other constructs. This being a fundamental ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its implementation. This is a basic course which goes along with other programming courses to develop an integrated ability to efficient  software  development,  hence this  course  is  very  important  for  computer engineers.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The course content should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop various types of related skills leading to the achievement of the following competency:

- Implement various types of Data Structures algorithms using Python.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The  practical  exercises,  the  underpinning  knowledge  and  the  relevant  soft  skills  associated  with  this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

The  practical  experiences  and  relevant  soft  skills  associated  with  this  course  are  to  be  taught  and implemented, so that the student demonstrates the following industry-oriented COs associated with the above-mentioned competency:

**a)** Comprehend the basic concepts of data structures, analysis terms, OOPs concepts, and recursive functions.<br>
**b)** Apply basic operations on stack, queue and linked list data structures.<br>
**c)** Apply basic operations on linked list data structure.<br>
**d)** Apply different sorting and searching algorithms to the small data sets.<br>

## Note

i. More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a suggestive list.<br>
ii. Care must be taken in assigning and assessing study report as it is a first year study report. Study report, data collection and analysis report must be assigned in a group. Teacher has to discuss about type of data (which and why) before group start their market survey.

The following are some sample 'Process' and 'Product' related skills (more may be added/deleted depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises of this course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

**c)** Practice environment friendly methods and processes.<br>
**d)** Follow safety precautions.

The  ADOs  are  best  developed  through  the  laboratory/field  based  exercises.  Moreover,  the  level  of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st year<br>
ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year<br>
iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  student-related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro project report should be as per suggested format, for other activities students and teachers  together  can  decide  the  format  of  the  report.  Students  should  also  collect/record  physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

a) Provide students with code snippets and ask them to identify the Big O notation for each one.<br>
b) Undertake micro-projects in teams.<br>
c) [Code.org](https://code.org/) - An hour of code may be organized and students are encouraged to participate<br>
d) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edX, Coursera, Udemy etc. to further enhance their learning.<br>
e) List the applications which are developed using Python data structures<br>
f) Encourage students to participate in different coding competitions like hackathon, online competitions on CodeChef etc.<br>
g) Encourage students to form a coding club at institute level and can help the slow learners.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.<br>
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.<br>
c) Managing Learning Environment<br>
d) Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help for students.<br>
e) Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the course material at his or her pace.<br>
f) Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be enhanced.<br>
g) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.<br>
h) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.<br>
i) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.<br>
j) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-  based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total  work  load  on  each  student  due  to  the  micro-project  should  be  about 16  (sixteen)  student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit microproject by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

a) Develop a Python Program that evaluate the given arithmetic expression using stack.<br>
b) Develop a Python Program that maintain a queue of persons. In this queue user can add a person, delete a person and search a person.<br>
c) Develop a Python Program that perform banking operations like withdraw cash, deposit cash and mini statement using appropriate data structure.<br>
d) Develop a Python Program for process management algorithm by using appropriate data structure.<br>
e) Develop a Python Program for print spooler using appropriate Data structure.<br>
f) Develop a Python Program for Telephone Directory system. In this user can adding, searching, modifying, listing, and deleting records through the use of appropriate data structure.<br>
g) Phone directory application using doubly-linked lists: This project can demonstrate the working of contact book applications and also teach you about data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Typically, phone book management encompasses searching, sorting, and deleting operations. A distinctive feature of the search queries here is that the user sees suggestions from the contact list after entering each character.<br>
h) Hangman Game: The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. A random word (E.g. a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game. When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.<br>
i) Stack and queue implementation using linked list: Develop a python program that implements stack and queue operations using linked list representation.
