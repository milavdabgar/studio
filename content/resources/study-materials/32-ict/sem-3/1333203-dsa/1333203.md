## 1. Rationale

Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture of machines efficiently
and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate various types of Data Structures and other
constructs. This being a fundamental ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its
implementation. This is a basic course which goes along with other programming courses to develop an
integrated ability to efficient software development, hence this course is very important for computer
engineers.

## 2. Competency

The course content should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop various types of related
skills leading to the achievement of the following competency:

- Implement various types of Data Structures algorithms using Python.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with this
competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

The practical experiences and relevant soft skills associated with this course are to be taught and
implemented, so that the student demonstrates the following industry-oriented COs associated with the
above-mentioned competency:

1. Comprehend the basic concepts of data structures, analysis terms, OOPs concepts, and
   recursive functions.
2. Apply basic operations on stack, queue and linked list data structures.
3. Apply basic operations on linked list data structure.
4. Apply different sorting and searching algorithms to the small data sets.
5. Illustrate algorithms to insert, delete and searching a node in tree.

## Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the above-mentioned
COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this course competency.

1. Work as a leader/a team member.
2. Follow ethical practices.
3. Practice environment friendly methods and processes.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of
achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should gradually increase
as planned below:

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this
course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for
each activity). For micro project report should be as per suggested format, for other activities students and
teachers together can decide the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical
evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful
for their placement interviews:

- Provide students with code snippets and ask them to identify the Big O notation for each one.

- Undertake micro-projects in teams.

- https://code.org/, an hour of code may be organized and students are encouraged to participate

- Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx, Coursera,
Udemy etc. to further enhance their learning.

- List the applications which are developed using Python data structures

- Encourage students to participate in different coding competitions like hackathon, online competitions
on code chef etc.

- Encourage students to form a coding club at institute level and can help the slow learners.

Data Structure and Application                                                              Course Code: 1333203

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- Managing Learning Environment
- Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help for students.
- Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the
course material at his or her pace.
- Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be enhanced.
- ‘L” in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature
is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the
knowledge of this course

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her
in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group
of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not
exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop- based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact,
## Practical Outcomes

```
      an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of
      individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The
      total work load on each student due to the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student
      engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit micro-
      project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).
            A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the
    course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Develop a Python Program that evaluate the given arithmetic expression using stack.
- Develop a Python Program that maintain a queue of persons. In this queue user can
            add a person, delete a person and search a person.

- Develop a Python Program that perform banking operations like withdraw cash,
             deposit cash and mini statement using appropriate data structure.
- Develop a Python Program for process management algorithm by using appropriate
- Develop a Python Program for print spooler using appropriate Data structure.
- Develop a Python Program for Telephone Directory system. In this user can adding,
             searching, modifying, listing, and deleting records through the use of appropriate data

- Phone directory application using doubly-linked lists- This project can demonstrate the
              working of contact book applications and also teach you about data structures like arrays,
              linked lists, stacks, and queues. Typically, phone book management encompasses searching,
              sorting, and deleting operations. A distinctive feature of the search queries here is that the
              user sees suggestions from the contact list after entering each character.
- Hangman Game: The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret
              words. A random word (E.g. a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player
              gets limited chances to win the game. When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that
              letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be
              guessed before all the chances are over.
- Stack and queue implementation using linked list: Develop a python program that
              implements stack and queue operations using linked list representation.
