  "rationale": "Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate various types of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its implementation. This is a basic course which goes along with other programming courses to develop an integrated ability to efficient software development, hence this course is very important for computer engineers.",
