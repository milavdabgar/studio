## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**What is modulation? What is the need of it?**

**Answer**:
Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a high-frequency carrier signal with a modulating signal containing information. 

**Table: Need for Modulation**

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Antenna Size | Reduces antenna size requirements (λ = c/f) |
| Multiplexing | Allows multiple signals to share the spectrum |
| Range | Increases transmission distance |
| Interference | Reduces noise interference |

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

**Explain Amplitude modulation with waveform and derive voltage equation for modulated signal also Sketch the frequency spectrum of the DSBFC AM.**

**Answer**:

Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a technique where the amplitude of a carrier wave is varied in proportion to the instantaneous amplitude of the modulating signal.

**Voltage Equation:**

- Carrier signal: v₁(t) = A₁ sin(ωct)
- Modulating signal: v₂(t) = A₂ sin(ωmt)
- Modulated signal: v(t) = A₁[1 + m sin(ωmt)] sin(ωct)
- Where m = A₂/A₁ (modulation index)

## Question 1(c) OR [7 marks]

**Derive the equation for total power in AM, calculate percentage of power savings in DSB and SSB.**

**Answer**:

**Derivation of Total Power in AM:**

- AM signal: v(t) = A₁[1 + m sin(ωmt)] sin(ωct)
- Total power: P = P₍carrier₎ + P₍sidebands₎
- P₍carrier₎ = A₁²/2
- P₍sidebands₎ = A₁²m²/4

**Table: Power Distribution in AM**

| Component | Power Expression | % of Total Power (m=1) |
|-----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Carrier | P₍c₎ = A₁²/2 | 66.67% |
| Sidebands | P₍s₎ = A₁²m²/4 | 33.33% |
| Total | P₍t₎ = A₁²(1+m²/2)/2 | 100% |

**Power Savings:**

- **DSB-SC**: 100% carrier power saved (66.67% of total power)
  - Only sidebands are transmitted
  - Percentage savings = (P₍c₎/P₍t₎) × 100 = 66.67%

- **SSB**: 50% of sideband power + 100% carrier power saved
  - One sideband + carrier removed
  - Percentage savings = (P₍c₎ + P₍s₎/2)/P₍t₎ × 100 = 83.33%
