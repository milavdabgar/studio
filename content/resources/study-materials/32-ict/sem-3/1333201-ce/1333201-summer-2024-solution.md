## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Define modulation and explain its need.**

**Answer**:
Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a high-frequency carrier signal with a modulating signal containing information.

**Table: Need for Modulation**

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

**Derive voltage equation for Amplitude modulation.**

**Answer**:
Amplitude modulation varies the amplitude of carrier signal proportionally to the message signal.

**Mathematical Derivation:**

- Let carrier signal be: c(t) = Ac cos(ωct)
- Message signal: m(t) = Am cos(ωmt)
- AM signal: s(t) = Ac[1 + μ·m(t)/Am]cos(ωct)
- Where μ = modulation index = Am/Ac
- Substituting m(t): s(t) = Ac[1 + μ·cos(ωmt)]cos(ωct)
- Expanding: s(t) = Ac·cos(ωct) + μ·Ac·cos(ωmt)·cos(ωct)
- Using identity (cos A·cos B): s(t) = Ac·cos(ωct) + (μ·Ac/2)[cos(ωc+ωm)t + cos(ωc-ωm)t]

## Question 1(c) OR [7 marks]

**Derive the equation for total power in AM, calculate percentage of power savings in DSB and SSB.**

**Answer**:
For an AM signal with modulation index μ, the total power consists of carrier power and sideband power.

**Table: Power Distribution in AM**

| Component | Power Formula | Percentage of Total Power |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------------|
| Carrier | Pc = Ac²/2 | 1/(1+μ²/2) × 100% |
| Upper Sideband | PUSB = Pc·μ²/4 | (μ²/4)/(1+μ²/2) × 100% |
| Lower Sideband | PLSB = Pc·μ²/4 | (μ²/4)/(1+μ²/2) × 100% |
| Total | PT = Pc(1+μ²/2) | 100% |

**Power Savings Calculation:**

- In DSB-SC: 100% carrier suppression = (Pc/PT)×100% = 1/(1+μ²/2)×100%
  - For μ = 1: Saving = 2/3×100% = 66.67%
- In SSB: One sideband + carrier suppression = (Pc+PLSB)/PT×100% = (1+μ²/4)/(1+μ²/2)×100%
  - For μ = 1: Saving = 5/6×100% = 83.33%

**Mnemonic:** "CAPS" - Carrier And Power in Sidebands

## Question 2(a) [3 marks]

**Define Image frequency in a radio receiver and explain it with suitable example.**

**Answer**:
Image frequency is an unwanted frequency that can produce the same IF (Intermediate Frequency) as the desired signal in a superheterodyne receiver.

**Table: Image Frequency**

| Parameter | Formula | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Desired Signal** | fs | 100 MHz |
| **Local Oscillator** | fLO | 110 MHz |
| **IF** | fIF = fLO - fs | 10 MHz |
| **Image Frequency** | fimage = fLO + fIF | 120 MHz |

If both 100 MHz and 120 MHz signals exist, both will produce 10 MHz IF, causing interference.

**Mnemonic:** "3-30-300-3000" - Each band starts at 3 times a power of 10 MHz

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Define the terms 1. Antenna Directivity 2. Polarization.**

**Answer**:

**Table: Antenna Properties**

| Term | Definition | Characteristics |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Directivity** | Ratio of radiation intensity in a given direction to average radiation intensity | Measured in dBi, indicates focus of antenna |
| **Polarization** | Orientation of electric field vector of radiated wave | Linear (vertical/horizontal), circular, elliptical |

**Mnemonic:** "DIVE POLE" - DIrectivity shows Vector Excellence, POLarization shows Electric field

## Question 5(c) OR [7 marks]

**Explain Ground wave propagation and Space wave propagation in detail.**

**Answer**:
These are two primary modes of radio wave propagation in the lower atmosphere.

**Table: Wave Propagation Comparison**

| Parameter | Ground Wave | Space Wave |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Frequency Range** | Below 2 MHz | Above 30 MHz |
| **Distance Coverage** | 100-300 km | Limited to line-of-sight + diffraction |
| **Path** | Follows earth's curvature | Direct and ground-reflected paths |
| **Mechanism** | Diffraction around earth's surface | Line-of-sight propagation with reflection |
| **Attenuation** | Higher (increases with frequency) | Lower at VHF/UHF ranges |
| **Polarization** | Vertical polarization preferred | Both vertical and horizontal usable |
| **Applications** | AM broadcasting, navigation beacons | TV, FM radio, microwave links |
| **Factors Affecting** | Ground conductivity, terrain | Antenna height, terrain, obstacles |

**Ground Wave Propagation:**

- Travels along earth's surface
- Signal strength decreases with distance
- Better propagation over sea than land
- Affected by ground conductivity and dielectric constant
- Used for AM broadcasting, maritime communication

**Space Wave Propagation:**

- Consists of direct wave and ground-reflected wave
- Range extended by atmospheric refraction
- Range formula: d = √(2Rh) where R is earth's radius, h is antenna height
- Affected by diffraction over obstacles
- Used for line-of-sight communications like TV, FM, microwave links

**Mnemonic:** "GAFFS" - Ground Adheres to earth, Follows surface, Frequencies low, Short wavelengths
