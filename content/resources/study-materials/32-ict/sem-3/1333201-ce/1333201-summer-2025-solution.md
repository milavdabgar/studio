- **Receiver**: Extracts original message from received signal
- **Destination**: Person/device for whom message is intended
- **Noise Source**: Unwanted signals that interfere with transmitted signal

**Mnemonic:** "I Transmit Communication Reliably Despite Noise"

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

**Explain Amplitude modulation with waveform and derive voltage equation for modulated signal also Sketch the frequency spectrum of the DSBFC AM.**

**Answer**:

Amplitude Modulation is the process where the amplitude of a high-frequency carrier wave varies according to the instantaneous value of the modulating signal.

**Waveform and Equation:**

![AM Waveform](diagrams/1333201-s2025-q1c.svg)

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Amplitude Modulation
    A["Message Signal m(t) = Am cos(ωm·t)"]
    B["Carrier Signal c(t) = Ac cos(ωc·t)"]
    C["AM Signal s(t) = Ac[1 + μ·cos(ωm·t)]cos(ωc·t)"]
    end
```

**Derivation of AM equation:**

- Carrier signal: c(t) = Ac cos(ωc·t)
- Modulating signal: m(t) = Am cos(ωm·t)
- Modulation Index: μ = Am/Ac
- AM signal: s(t) = Ac[1 + μ·cos(ωm·t)]cos(ωc·t)
- Expanding: s(t) = Ac·cos(ωc·t) + μ·Ac/2·cos[(ωc+ωm)t] + μ·Ac/2·cos[(ωc-ωm)t]

**DSBFC AM Frequency Spectrum:**

    |     |    |    |
    |_____|____|____|_____
         fc-fm fc  fc+fm
```

**Key Points:**

- **LSB (Lower Sideband)**: Located at fc-fm
- **USB (Upper Sideband)**: Located at fc+fm
- **Bandwidth**: 2fm (twice the highest modulating frequency)

**Mnemonic:** "CARrying Two SideBands" - DSBFC AM carries both sidebands.

## Question 1(c OR) [7 marks]

**Derive the equation for total power in AM, calculate percentage of power savings in DSBFC And SSBSC.**

**Answer**:

**Total Power in AM:**

For AM signal s(t) = Ac[1 + μ·cos(ωm·t)]cos(ωc·t)

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph AM Power Distribution
    A[Carrier Power: Pc = Ac²/2]
    B[Total Sideband Power: PUSB + PLSB = Pc·μ²/2]
    C["Total Power: Pt = Pc(1 + μ²/2)"]
    end
```

**Power Calculation:**

- Carrier Power: Pc = Ac²/2
- Power in each sideband: PUSB = PLSB = Pc·μ²/4
- Total Sideband Power: PUSB + PLSB = Pc·μ²/2
- Total Power: Pt = Pc + PUSB + PLSB = Pc(1 + μ²/2)

**Power Savings:**

| Modulation | Power Distribution | Power Savings |
|------------|-------------------|---------------|
| DSBFC AM | Uses carrier + both sidebands | 0% (reference) |
| SSBSC AM | Uses only one sideband, no carrier | (2 - μ²/2)/(1 + μ²/2) × 100% |

For μ = 1, SSBSC saves approximately 85% power compared to DSBFC.

**Mnemonic:** "SSB Saves Power By Cutting Carrier"

## Question 2(a) [3 marks]

**Compare AM and FM.**

**Answer**:

| Parameter | AM | FM |
|-----------|----|----|
| **Definition** | Amplitude of carrier varies with message signal | Frequency of carrier varies with message signal |
| **Bandwidth** | 2 × message frequency | 2 × (Δf + fm) |
| **Noise Immunity** | Poor (noise affects amplitude) | Excellent (noise mainly affects amplitude) |
