Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions  assess  the  attainment  of  the  UOs.  The  actual  distribution  of  marks  at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various  outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare specification of electronic components/ICs used in communication system.

- b) Give  seminar  on  modulators,  demodulators  and  communication  techniques,  types and applications.
- c) Prepare a PPT/animation of various pulse modulation techniques.
- d) Undertake a survey of different communication methods used in field.
- e) Prepare chart of radiation pattern of various antenna.
- f) Prepare the PPT/animations of 3-D radiation pattern and wave propagation of radio waves.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive  open  online  courses  ( MOOCs )  may  be  used  to  teach  various  topics/sub topics.
- b) In Unit I various equation of AM, FM and PM can be explained without mathematical derivations.
- c) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- d) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- e) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- f) With respect to section No.11 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- g) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability
- h) Guide students for using data manuals.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based.  However,  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters,  it  should  be  preferably  be individually undertaken  to  build  up  the  skill  and  confidence  in  every  student  to  become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a  seminar  presentation  of  it  before  submission.  The  total  duration  of  the  micro-project should  not  be  less  than 16  (sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Build AM transmitter circuit using transistor/IC.
- b) Demonstrate AM communication System including AM transmitter and receiver.
- c) Build FM Transmitter circuit using IC.

- d) Demonstrate FM communication System including FM transmitter and receiver.
- e) Build a PAM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.
- f) Build a PWM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.
- g) Build a PPM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.
- h) Demonstrate Analog Communication system on Virtual Lab.
- i) Visit nearby FM radio station and prepare brief report including Gain, Frequency and Area specifications.
- j) Prepare Chart on Different Pulse Modulation techniques.
- k) Prepare Chart on Different line coding techniques.
- l) To  prepare  chart  for  recent  trends  of  antenna  applications  i.e.  PCB  mounted miniature  antennas,  Automobile  antennas,  Car  Keys  antennas,  Wi-Fi  adaptor antennas, LORA antennas, IOT gateways antennas etc.
