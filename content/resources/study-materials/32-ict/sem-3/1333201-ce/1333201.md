above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow safety practices while using electrical appliances.
- Practice environment friendly methods and processes. (Environment related)

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at
different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above
table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare specification of electronic components/ICs used in communication system.

Communication Engineering                                                      Course Code: 1333201

- Give seminar on modulators, demodulators and communication techniques, types
and applications.
- Prepare a PPT/animation of various pulse modulation techniques.
- Undertake a survey of different communication methods used in field.
- Prepare chart of radiation pattern of various antenna.
- Prepare the PPT/animations of 3-D radiation pattern and wave propagation of radio
waves.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- In Unit I various equation of AM, FM and PM can be explained without mathematical
derivations.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability
- Guide students for using data manuals.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
 maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give
 a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project
 should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The
 student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry
 oriented COs.
         A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Build AM transmitter circuit using transistor/IC.
- Demonstrate AM communication System including AM transmitter and receiver.
- Build FM Transmitter circuit using IC.

- Demonstrate FM communication System including FM transmitter and receiver.
- Build a PAM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.
- Build a PWM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.
- Build a PPM Modulator using 555/OPAMP.
- Demonstrate Analog Communication system on Virtual Lab.
- Visit nearby FM radio station and prepare brief report including Gain, Frequency and
          Area specifications.
- Prepare Chart on Different Pulse Modulation techniques.
- Prepare Chart on Different line coding techniques.
- To prepare chart for recent trends of antenna applications i.e. PCB mounted
          miniature antennas, Automobile antennas, Car Keys antennas, Wi-Fi adaptor
          antennas, LORA antennas, IOT gateways antennas etc.
