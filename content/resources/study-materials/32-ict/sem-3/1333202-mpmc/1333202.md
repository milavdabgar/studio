## 1. RATIONALE

The engineering technologists (i.e. diploma engineering holders) have to develop skills for system design of Automatic circuit operations in various fields. Microprocessors &amp; Microcontroller are the sole of all embedded electronic equipment and are used in most of the areas of electronics. They include product ranges from tiny consumer electronic products to complex industrial process controllers. A diploma engineer needs to maintain such systems. Programming practices will further help the students to develop indigenous microcontrollerbased  applications.  Hence  this  course  is  designed  to  achieve  the  system  maintenance competency among students.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

- Demonstrate microprocessor-based system.
- Implement microcontroller-based system/equipment.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The theory should be taught and practical should be carried out in such a manner that students are  able  to  acquire  different  learning  outcomes  in  cognitive,  psychomotor  and  affective domain to demonstrate following course outcomes.

i. Identify basic features of microprocessor ii. Explain architecture and working of microprocessor iii. Illustrate microcontroller internal architecture iv. Write and execute assembly language programs(software) for given application v.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The  ADOs are  best  developed  through  the  laboratory/field-based  exercises.  Moreover,  the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students

and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of each activity.

- i)  Prepare journals based on practical performed in laboratory.
2. ii) Prepare chart to represent the block diagram of different interfacing chips. Develop a practical application using 8051 Microcontroller
3. iv) Prepare General purpose board with all ports available as connector                                    v) Prepare/Download a dynamic animation to illustrate the following
- Data transfer operation • Keypad Interfacing
- LCD Interfacing.          • LM35 Interfacing

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) Some of  the topics/sub-topics is  relatively simple and very easy to the students for self-learning , but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- d) With respect to section No.09 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- e) Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine.
- f) Arrange visit to relevant industry
- g) Show video lectures on Microcontroller Applications with help of internet.

- h) Assembly level programming practices on simulators (free downloadable).

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three. The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.

## MICRO PROJECT 1: Prepare following Items.

1. Prepare Table for Instruction classification.
2. Design a chart of 8085/8051 Architecture.

## MIICRO PROJECT 2: Prepare following Designs.

1. Design minimum hardware system for 8051 circuit.
2. Develop 8051 based application board/circuit on PCB.

MICRO PROJECT 3: Design Application oriented basic Project using 8051.

1. Design and Implement LED flasher circuit.
2. Design and Implement circuit for relay-based operation using switch.
3. Design and Implement LCD Interfacing circuit displaying your name on it.
4. Design and Implement Room Temperature controller circuit.
