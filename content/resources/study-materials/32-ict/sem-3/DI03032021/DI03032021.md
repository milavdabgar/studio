## Prerequisite

Basic computer programming concepts: Students should have a foundational understanding of programming principles, including variables, control structures, data types, and basic algorithms. Familiarity with any programming language, such as C or Python, is recommended.

## Course Description

This course is designed to teach object-oriented programming concepts, techniques, and applications using the Java programming language. Java is a simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture-neutral, object-oriented programming language that enables development of applications for diverse computing platforms.

## Rationale

The aim of this course is for students to master platform-independent object-oriented programming with Java as the foundation for advanced technologies like web applications, cloud computing, and enterprise systems. Students will learn to design, implement, test, and debug Java applications using object-oriented principles. The course emphasizes hands-on programming experience through practical exercises and projects that reinforce theoretical concepts and develop problem-solving abilities.

## Course Outcomes

After completion of the course, students will be able to:

| No. | Course Outcomes | RBT Level |
