| Category of the Course:   | PCC       |

Prerequisite:

Basic  computer  programming  concepts:  Students  should  have  a  foundational understanding of programming principles, including variables, control structures, data types, and basic algorithms. Familiarity with any programming language, such as C or Python, is recommended.

This course is designed to teach object-oriented programming concepts, techniques, and applications using the Java programming language. Java is a simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture-neutral, object-oriented programming  language  that  enables  development  of  applications  for  diverse computing platforms.

## Rationale:

The  aim  of  this  course  is  for  students  to  master  platform-independent  objectoriented programming with Java as the foundation for advanced technologies like web applications, cloud computing, and enterprise systems. Students will learn to design, implement,  test, and  debug  Java  applications using object-oriented principles.  The  course  emphasizes  hands-on  programming  experience  through practical  exercises  and  projects  that  reinforce  theoretical  concepts  and  develop problem-solving abilities.

## Course Outcome:

After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

## Suggested Project List:

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. Library Management System : Implement a system to manage books, members, and borrowing with proper data validation, exception handling, and file-based persistence.
2. Student  Information  System :  Create  an  application  that  maintains  student  records,  course enrolments, and grade calculations using inheritance for different student types.
3. E-commerce Cart Management : Develop a console-based shopping cart system with product categories (using inheritance), order management, and data persistence.
4. Task Management Application : Build a task tracker with task categories, priorities, deadlines, and status updates using collections and file handling.
5. Quiz Management System :  Create an interactive quiz application with question types (using inheritance), scoring, timer functionality (using threads), and result storage.
6. Personal Finance Manager :  Develop an application to track income, expenses, and budgets, with data visualization, categorization, and persistence.
