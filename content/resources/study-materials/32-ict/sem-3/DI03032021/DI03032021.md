Basic computer programming concepts: Students should have a foundational
understanding of programming principles, including variables, control structures,
Prerequisite:
data types, and basic algorithms. Familiarity with any programming language, such
as C or Python, is recommended.
This course is designed to teach object-oriented programming concepts, techniques,
and applications using the Java programming language. Java is a simple, portable,
distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture-neutral, object-oriented
programming language that enables development of applications for diverse
computing platforms.

The aim of this course is for students to master platform-independent object-
Rationale:
oriented programming with Java as the foundation for advanced technologies like
web applications, cloud computing, and enterprise systems. Students will learn to
design, implement, test, and debug Java applications using object-oriented
principles. The course emphasizes hands-on programming experience through
practical exercises and projects that reinforce theoretical concepts and develop
problem-solving abilities.

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

Suggested Activities for Students:
1. Code Review Sessions: Organize peer code review sessions where students can present their
code and receive constructive feedback from their classmates. This helps in improving coding
practices and learning from each other.
2. Hackathons: Conduct hackathons where students can work on real-world projects in teams. This
