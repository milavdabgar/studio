# GUJARAT TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY (GTU)

Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)
Semester -III

Course Title: Database Management System
- Course Code: 1333204)

Diploma programme in which this course is offered           Semester in which offered
Information and Communication Technology                   3rd Semester

## 1. Rationale

The aim of this course is to get understanding of the basic concepts of database management
system used for business, scientific and engineering application which stored centralized. The
students will develop the skills to design and develop database using different database models
manage & retrieve data from different perspective using Structured Query Language (SQL) in
- RACLE (centralized storage) so there is no need of storing data in files and paper. This helps
students to design ER-models to represent simple databases and convert them into relational
tables, populate relational databases and formulate SQL queries on data. Students will improve
database design through normalization. Students will understand how database systems must
provide for the safety of the stored information, despite system crashes or attempts at
unauthorized access.

## 2. Competency

The course should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop various types of skills
so that students are able to acquire following competency:

- Design and develop database for given applications and manage them through different
Structured Query Language (SQL) operations in Oracle.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with
this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of database systems
- Design database using Entity Relationship approach
- Apply SQL commands to create, modify, and manipulate databases.
- Apply concepts of normalization to design an optimal database.
- Explain transaction management concepts for concurrent use of database.

## 6. MAJOR EQUIPMENT/ INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED
- Hardware: Computer Systems with minimum PIV processor (o r equivalent)and
- GB RAM.
- Software: SQL/PLSQL supporting software. (e.g. Oracle, SQL Server,MySQL)

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
 above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
 competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
- Practice environment friendly methods and processes. (Environment related)

 The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
 level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
 should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
     ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
     iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

```

## 9. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students
and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher
to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Note: The UOs need to be formulated at the ‘Applcation Level’ and above of Revised Bloom’s
Taxonomy’ to accelerate the attainment of the COs and the competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different
taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above table.

## 11. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare
reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their
(student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare seminar presentations explaining the organization of database in
various livesystems like banking, insurance, online store etc.
ii. Prepare power point presentation for different SQL Statements.
iii. Prepare case study explaining the need for converting a large table to many
smallertables using 1NF, 2NF, 3NF
iv. Design database which can be used in the course on .net programming

- 2. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.

Relational Database Management Systems                                                Course Code: 1333204

- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environ and sustainability

- 3. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to
be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four
semesters, the micro-projectare group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth
semesters, it should be preferably beindividually undertaken to build up the
skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he
contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups
have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based,
workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should
## Practical Outcomes

```
     encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and
- DOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of
     individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of
     it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less
     than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student
     ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the
     industry orientedCOs.

     A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the
     competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the
     concerned course teacher:
- Students have to perform the following steps for any chosen project.

- Choose any topic of your choice and enlist its requirements.
- Draw an ER Diagram for your chosen topic and prepare tables,
             establish relationshipsbetween them.
- Normalize the database.
- Determine the different scenarios and how data will be fetched with queries.
- Write the relational algebra queries for queries mentioned.
 Sample Project Definitions: Hotel management,Event Management,Hospital
 Management,Health Monitoring Management System, Airline Management, Bank
 Management system, Transportation Management System, Library Management
 System etc
