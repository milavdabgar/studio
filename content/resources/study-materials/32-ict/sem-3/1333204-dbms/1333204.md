## 1. RATIONALE

The aim of this course is to get understanding of the basic concepts of database management system used for business, scientific and engineering application which stored centralized. The students will develop the skills to design and develop database using different database models manage &amp; retrieve data from different perspective using Structured Query Language (SQL) in ORACLE (centralized storage) so there is no need of storing data in files and paper.  This helps students to design ER-models to represent simple databases and convert them into relational tables, populate relational databases and formulate SQL queries on data. Students will improve database design through normalization. Students will understand how database systems must provide  for  the  safety  of  the  stored  information,  despite  system  crashes  or  attempts  at unauthorized access.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The course should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop various types of skills so that students are able to acquire following competency:

- ï‚· Design and develop database for given applications and manage them through different Structured Query Language (SQL) operations in Oracle.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

- a. Understand the fundamental concepts of database systems
- b. Design database using Entity Relationship approach
- c. Apply SQL commands to create, modify, and manipulate databases.
- d. Apply concepts of normalization to design an optimal database.
- e. Explain transaction management concepts  for concurrent use of database.

## 6. MAJOR EQUIPMENT/ INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED

- a. Hardware: Computer Systems with minimum PIV processor (or equivalent)  a n d 1 GB RAM.
- b. Software: SQL/PLSQL supporting software. (e.g. Oracle, SQL Server,  MySQL)

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfil  the  development  of  this competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.
- c) Practice environment friendly methods and processes. (Environment related)

The  ADOs are  best  developed  through  the  laboratory/field-based  exercises.  Moreover,  the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 9. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above table.

## 11. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports  of  about  5  pages  for  each  activity,  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- i. Prepare seminar presentations explaining the organization of database in various live  systems like banking, insurance, online store etc.
- ii. Prepare power point presentation for different SQL Statements.
- iii. Prepare  case  study  explaining  the  need  for  converting  a  large  table  to  many smaller  tables using 1NF, 2NF, 3NF
- iv. Design database which can be used in the course on .net programming

## 12. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.

- e) With respect to section No.11 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- f) Guide students on how to address issues on environ and sustainability

## 13. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to  him/her  in  the  beginning  of  the  semester.  In  the  first  four semesters,  the  micro-project  are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill  and  confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to  be  formed  for  micro-projects,  the  number  of  students  in  the  group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to  maintain  a dated  work  diary  consisting  of individual contributions in the project work and give  a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry orientedCOs.

A  suggestive  list  of  micro-projects  is  given  here.  This  has  to  match  the competency  and  the  COs.  Similar  micro-projects  could  be  added  by  the concerned course teacher:

Students have to perform the following steps for any chosen project.

- a) Choose any topic of your choice and enlist its requirements.
- b) Draw an ER Diagram for your chosen topic and prepare tables, establish relationships  between them.
- c) Normalize the database.
- d) Determine the different scenarios and how data will be fetched with queries.
- e) Write the relational algebra queries for queries mentioned.

Sample  Project  Definitions:  Hotel  management,Event  Management,Hospital Management,Health Monitoring Management System, Airline Management, Bank Management system, Transportation Management System, Library Management System etc
