## 1. RATIONALE

The aim of this course is to get understanding of the basic concepts of database management system used for business, scientific and engineering application which stored centralized. The students will develop the skills to design and develop database using different database models manage & retrieve data from different perspective using Structured Query Language (SQL) in ORACLE (centralized storage) so there is no need of storing data in files and paper.  This helps students to design ER-models to represent simple databases and convert them into relational tables, populate relational databases and formulate SQL queries on data. Students will improve database design through normalization. Students will understand how database systems must provide  for  the  safety  of  the  stored  information,  despite  system  crashes  or  attempts  at unauthorized access.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The course should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop various types of skills so that students are able to acquire following competency:

- Design and develop database for given applications and manage them through different Structured Query Language (SQL) operations in Oracle.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

- a. Understand the fundamental concepts of database systems
- b. Design database using Entity Relationship approach
- c. Apply SQL commands to create, modify, and manipulate databases.
- d. Apply concepts of normalization to design an optimal database.
- e. Explain transaction management concepts for concurrent use of database.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above table.

## 11. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- i. Prepare seminar presentations explaining the organization of database in various live systems like banking, insurance, online store etc.
- ii. Prepare power point presentation for different SQL Statements.
- iii. Prepare case study explaining the need for converting a large table to many smaller tables using 1NF, 2NF, 3NF
- iv. Design database which can be used in the course on .net programming

## 12. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- f) Guide students on how to address issues on environ and sustainability

## 13. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

Students have to perform the following steps for any chosen project.

- a) Choose any topic of your choice and enlist its requirements.
- b) Draw an ER Diagram for your chosen topic and prepare tables, establish relationships between them.
- c) Normalize the database.
- d) Determine the different scenarios and how data will be fetched with queries.
- e) Write the relational algebra queries for queries mentioned.

**Sample Project Definitions**: Hotel management, Event Management, Hospital Management, Health Monitoring Management System, Airline Management, Bank Management system, Transportation Management System, Library Management System etc
