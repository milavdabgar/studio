| Rationale:      | Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture  of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate  various  types  of  Data  Structures  and  other  constructs.  This  being  a  fundamental  ability  which  is  language  neutral  yet  requires  use  of  a  language  for  its  implementation. This is a basic course which goes along with other programming  courses to develop an integrated ability to efficient software development, hence this  course is very important for computer engineers |

## Suggested Project List:

A  suggestive  list  of  micro-projects  is  given  here.  This  should  relate  highly  with competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Develop a Python Program that evaluate the given arithmetic expression using stack.
- b) Develop a Python Program that maintain a queue of persons. In this queue user can add a person, delete a person and search a person.
- c) Develop  a  Python  Program  that  perform  banking  operations  like withdraw cash, deposit  cash and mini statement using  appropriate data structure.
- d) Develop a Python Program for process management algorithm by using appropriate data structure.
- e) Develop a Python Program for print spooler using appropriate Data structure.
- f) Develop a Python Program for Telephone Directory system. In this user can adding, searching, modifying, listing, and deleting records through the use of appropriate data structure.
- g) Phone  directory  application  using  doubly-linked  listsThis  project  can demonstrate the working of contact book applications and also teach you about data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Typically, phone book management  encompasses  searching,  sorting, and  deleting operations.  A distinctive feature of the search queries here is that the user sees suggestions from the contact list after entering each character.
- h) Hangman Game: The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. A random word (E.g. a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game. When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
- i) Stack and queue implementation using linked list: Develop a python program

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co- curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro project report should be as per suggested format, for other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of the report. Students  should  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  such  as  photographs/videos  of  the activities for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a)  Provide students with code snippets and ask them to identify the Big O notation for each one.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- c)  https://code.org/, an hour of code may be organized and students are encouraged to participate
- d) Students  are  encouraged  to  register  themselves  in  various  MOOCs  such  as:  Swayam,  edx, Coursera, Udemy etc. to further enhance their learning.
- e)  List the applications which are developed using Python data structures
- f)  Encourage  students  to  participate  in  different  coding  competitions  like  hackathon,  online competitions on code chef etc.
- g) Encourage students to form a coding club at institute level and can help the slow learners.
