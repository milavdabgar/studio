**Academic Year:** 2024-25
Semester:                            3rd
Category of the Course:              PCC

Prerequisite:        Computer Basics
Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture
of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate
various types of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental
Rationale:           ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its
implementation. This is a basic course which goes along with other programming
courses to develop an integrated ability to efficient software development, hence this
course is very important for computer engineers

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

## UNDERPINNING THEORY:

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If required, more such UOs
could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Suggested Project List:

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with
competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned
course teacher:
- Develop a Python Program that evaluate the given arithmetic expression using stack.
- Develop a Python Program that maintain a queue of persons. In this queue
user can add a person, delete a person and search a person.
- Develop a Python Program that perform banking operations like
withdraw cash, deposit cash and mini statement using appropriate
data structure.
- Develop a Python Program for process management algorithm by using
appropriate data structure.
- Develop a Python Program for print spooler using appropriate Data structure.
- Develop a Python Program for Telephone Directory system. In this user can
adding, searching, modifying, listing, and deleting records through the use
of appropriate data structure.

- Phone directory application using doubly-linked lists- This project can
demonstrate the working of contact book applications and also teach you about
data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Typically, phone book
management encompasses searching, sorting, and deleting operations. A
distinctive feature of the search queries here is that the user sees suggestions
from the contact list after entering each character.
- Hangman Game: The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a
list of secret words. A random word (E.g. a fruit name) is picked up from our
collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game. When a letter in
that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In
this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
- Stack and queue implementation using linked list: Develop a python program

Suggested Activities for Students:

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co- curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare small
reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro project report should be as per suggested
format, for other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of the report.
Students should also collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the
