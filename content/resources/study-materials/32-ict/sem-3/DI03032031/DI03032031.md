| **Rationale**            | Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate various types of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its implementation. This is a basic course which goes along with other programming courses to develop an integrated ability to efficient software development, hence this course is very important for computer engineers. |

## Suggested Project List

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

a) **Arithmetic Expression Evaluator**: Develop a Python Program that evaluates the given arithmetic expression using stack.

b) **Person Queue Management**: Develop a Python Program that maintains a queue of persons. In this queue user can add a person, delete a person and search a person.

c) **Banking Operations System**: Develop a Python Program that performs banking operations like withdraw cash, deposit cash and mini statement using appropriate data structure.

d) **Process Management Algorithm**: Develop a Python Program for process management algorithm by using appropriate data structure.

e) **Print Spooler**: Develop a Python Program for print spooler using appropriate Data structure.

f) **Telephone Directory System**: Develop a Python Program for Telephone Directory system. In this user can add, search, modify, list, and delete records through the use of appropriate data structure.

g) **Phone Directory using Doubly-Linked Lists**: This project can demonstrate the working of contact book applications and also teach you about data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Typically, phone book management encompasses searching, sorting, and deleting operations. A distinctive feature of the search queries here is that the user sees suggestions from the contact list after entering each character.

h) **Hangman Game**: The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. A random word (e.g., a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game. When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.

i) **Stack and Queue Implementation using Linked List**: Develop a Python program that implements stack and queue operations using linked list representation.

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro project report should be as per suggested format, for other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

a) **Algorithm Analysis**: Provide students with code snippets and ask them to identify the Big O notation for each one.

b) **Team Projects**: Undertake micro-projects in teams.

c) **Hour of Code**: Visit [Code.org](https://code.org/) - an hour of code may be organized and students are encouraged to participate.

d) **MOOCs Participation**: Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, EdX, Coursera, Udemy etc. to further enhance their learning.

e) **Application Research**: List the applications which are developed using Python data structures.

f) **Coding Competitions**: Encourage students to participate in different coding competitions like hackathon, online competitions on CodeChef etc.

g) **Coding Club**: Encourage students to form a coding club at institute level and can help the slow learners.
