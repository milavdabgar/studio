Sarah: Let's dive into Java's fascinating history! Dr. James, could you tell us how it all began?

Dr. James: Absolutely, Sarah! Java's story is quite interesting. It all started back in 1991 with something called Project Green at Sun Microsystems.

Sarah: And the key people behind this revolution?

Dr. James: Well, we have to give credit to James Gosling - he's known as the "Father of Java". He worked alongside Mike Sheridan and Patrick Naughton to create what would become one of the world's most important programming languages.

Sarah: And what were their original goals? What problem were they trying to solve?

Dr. James: Great question! They had five main goals: Platform Independence, Network-oriented design, Security, Simplicity, and Object-oriented programming. Little did they know they were creating something that would revolutionize software development!
