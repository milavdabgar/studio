"Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA)
</div>

<!--
Now let's explore why Java was created in the first place.

[click] Originally, Java wasn't intended for the applications we know it for today. It was designed for interactive television systems.

[click] The team wanted to create software for consumer electronics like televisions and VCRs.

[click] Set-top boxes were becoming popular, and Java was meant to provide interactive features.

[click] The focus was on embedded systems that needed reliable, compact software.

[click] However, the 1990s brought the internet boom, which changed everything.

[click] As the World Wide Web exploded in popularity, there was a desperate need for platform-independent software.

[click] Web applications needed to be secure since they would run on users' computers.

[click] Java applets became a way to bring interactive content to web browsers.

[click] This led to Java's famous motto: "Write Once, Run Anywhere" - meaning you could write your code once and it would run on any computer platform without modification.

<strong>Key Point:</strong> Same bytecode runs on different platforms thanks to JVM!
</div>
</div>

<!--
Let me explain one of Java's most important concepts - platform independence.

[click] The diagram shows how Java achieves its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability.

It starts with your Java source code, which you write in files with a .java extension.

[click] When you compile this source code using the Java compiler called javac, it doesn't produce machine code specific to your computer's processor.

Instead, it creates something called Java bytecode, stored in .class files.

[click] This bytecode is platform-neutral - it's not specific to Windows, Linux, or macOS.

[click] Here's where the magic happens: each operating system has its own Java Virtual Machine, or JVM.

The JVM for Windows converts bytecode to Windows machine code.

[click] The JVM for Linux converts the same bytecode to Linux machine code.

[click] And the JVM for macOS converts it to macOS machine code.

[click] This means the same bytecode can run on completely different operating systems without any changes.

The key insight is that the JVM acts as a translator between your platform-independent bytecode and the specific machine code needed by each operating system.

This is why Java developers can write an application once and distribute it to users on any platform - the JVM handles all the platform-specific details.

<!--
Let's recap what we've accomplished in this introductory lecture.

[click] We've covered Java's fascinating history, from its origins in Project Green for interactive television to becoming one of the world's most important programming languages.

You now understand the key features that make Java special - platform independence, security, object-oriented design, and robustness.

We explored the concept of platform independence and how the Java Virtual Machine enables the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy.

You've seen the vast array of real-world applications where Java is used, from the apps on your phone to the banking systems that handle your money.

And you understand why Java has become the preferred choice for enterprise development worldwide.

[click] Looking ahead, our next steps are equally exciting. We'll install the Java Development Kit on your computers, set up a proper development environment, and write our very first Java program.

You'll learn about the compilation process, understand how Java code becomes bytecode, and see firsthand how Java programs execute.

We'll practice with simple examples that will build your confidence and prepare you for more advanced programming concepts.

[click] With this solid foundation in place, you're ready to embark on your journey into practical Java programming. The skills you'll learn will open doors to careers in software development, mobile app creation, and enterprise system design.

Java's popularity and demand in the job market make it an excellent choice for your programming education!
