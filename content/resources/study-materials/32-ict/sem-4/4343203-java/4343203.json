  "rationale": "This course is designed to teach object-oriented programming concepts, techniques, and applications using the Java programming language. Object-oriented programming emphasis on the fundamentals of the structured design with classes, including development, testing, implementation and documentation also includes object-oriented programming techniques, classes and objects.\n\nJava is a simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture neutral, object oriented programming language. Java programming language is designed to enable the development of a small, reliable, portable, distributed, real-time operating platform, high-performance applications for the widest range of computing platforms possible as well as cross-platform interaction. By making applications available across heterogeneous environments, businesses can provide more services, boost end-user productivity, communication and collaboration to enterprise and consumer applications.\n\nThe Java programming language originated as part of a research project to develop advanced software for a wide variety of network devices and embedded systems. The Java programming language is used as the teaching vehicle for this course.\n\nThe aim of this course is that student should learn platform independent object oriented programming and java as base language for advanced technology like three tier architecture applications, cloud computing and web development. Java is also used to program electronic hardware devices such as air conditioners, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and many others.",
