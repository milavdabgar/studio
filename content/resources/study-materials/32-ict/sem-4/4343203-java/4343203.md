## 1. RATIONALE

This  course  is  designed  to  teach  object-oriented  programming  concepts,  techniques,  and applications using the Java programming language. Object-oriented programming emphasis on the fundamentals of the structured design with classes, including development, testing, implementation  and  documentation  also  includes  object-oriented  programming  techniques, classes and objects. Java is a simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture neutral, object oriented programming language.Java programming language is designed to enable the  development of a small, reliable, portable, distributed,  real-time  operating platform, highperformance applications for the widest range of computing platforms possible as well as crossplatform  interaction.  By  making  applications  available  across  heterogeneous  environments, businesses can provide more  services, boost end-user productivity,  communication  and collaboration to enterprise and consumer applications. The Java programming language originated as part of a research project to develop advanced software for a wide variety of network devices and embedded systems. The Java programming language is used as the teaching vehicle for this course.

The  aim  of  this  course  is  that  student  should  learn  platform  independent  object  oriented programming  and  java  as  base  language  for  advanced  technology  like  three  tier  architecture applications,  cloud  computing  and  web  development.Java  is  also  used  to  program  electronic hardware devices such as air conditioners, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and many others.

## 6. MAJOR EQUIPMENT/ INSTRUMENTS AND SOFTWARE REQUIRED

These major equipment/instruments and Software required to develop PrOs are given below with broad specifications to facilitate procurement of them by the administrators/management of the institutes. This will ensure conduction of practical in all institutions across the state in proper way so that the desired skills are developed in students.

|   S.  No. | Equipment Name with Broad Specifications                                      | PrO. No.   |

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the abovementioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this competency.

- a) Motivation and Attitude towards learning
- b) Learning Methodology and Communication styles
- c) Use of technology
- d) Work as a leader/a team member.
- e) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

Course Code: 4343203

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

The major Underpinning Theory is formulated as given below and only higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy are mentioned for development of the COs and competency in the students by the teachers. (Higher level UOs automatically includes lower level UOs in them). If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning and to  teachers  to  teach  and  question  paper  designers/setters  to  formulate  test  items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare small reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro project report should be as per suggested format, for other  activities  students  and  teachers  together  can  decide  the  format  of  the  report.  Students should also collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- b) List different versions of java and their new features
- c) Prepare charts to explain use/process of the identified topic.
- d) https://java-iitd.vlabs.ac.in/this  website  provides  virtual  lab  and  gives  simulation  of  java programs.
- e) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edX, Coursera, Udemy etc. to further enhance their learning.
- f) https://www.codechef.comthis website gives competitive programming problems, students are expected to solve examples and crosscheck with output.
- g) Encourage students to form a coding club at institute level and can help the slow learners

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) Managing Learning Environment
- d) Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help for students.
- e) Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the course material at his or her pace.
- f) Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be enhanced.
- g) 'CI' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.

Course Code: 4343203

- h) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using  different  assessment methods.
- i) With  respect  to section  No.10 ,  teachers  need  to  ensure  to  create  opportunities  and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- j) Guide  students  on  how  to  address  issues  on  environment  and  sustainability  using  the knowledge of this course

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are groupbased (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting  of  individual  contribution  in  the  project  work  and  give  a  seminar  presentation  of  it before submission. The total work load on each student due to   the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. Student Record Keeping System
2. Inventory Management System
3. Airline reservation system
4. Electricity billing system
5. Healthcare management system
6. Library management system
7. Bank management system
8. Medical management system
9. Quiz management system
10. Survey System
11. Stock management system
12. Tic Tac Toe Game
13. Chess Game
14. Battleship Console Game
