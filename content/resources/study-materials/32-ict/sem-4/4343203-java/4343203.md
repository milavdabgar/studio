## 1. RATIONALE

This course is designed to teach object-oriented programming concepts, techniques, and applications using the Java programming language. Object-oriented programming emphasis on the fundamentals of the structured design with classes, including development, testing, implementation and documentation also includes object-oriented programming techniques, classes and objects.

Java is a simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture neutral, object oriented programming language. Java programming language is designed to enable the development of a small, reliable, portable, distributed, real-time operating platform, high-performance applications for the widest range of computing platforms possible as well as cross-platform interaction. By making applications available across heterogeneous environments, businesses can provide more services, boost end-user productivity, communication and collaboration to enterprise and consumer applications.

The Java programming language originated as part of a research project to develop advanced software for a wide variety of network devices and embedded systems. The Java programming language is used as the teaching vehicle for this course.

The aim of this course is that student should learn platform independent object oriented programming and java as base language for advanced technology like three tier architecture applications, cloud computing and web development. Java is also used to program electronic hardware devices such as air conditioners, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and many others.

f) [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com) - this website gives competitive programming problems, students are expected to solve examples and crosscheck with output<br>
g) Encourage students to form a coding club at institute level and can help the slow learners

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics<br>
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects<br>

j) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total work load on each student due to the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. Student Record Keeping System
2. Inventory Management System
3. Airline reservation system
4. Electricity billing system
5. Healthcare management system
6. Library management system
7. Bank management system
