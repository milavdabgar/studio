# Java Programming Syllabus

**Course Code:** 4343203  
**Institution:** Gujarat Technological University (GTU)  
**Curriculum:** Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)  
**Semester:** IV  
**Programme:** Diploma in Information and Communication Technology

## 1. Rationale

This course introduces object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts, techniques, and applications using Java. Java is a simple, portable, robust, secure, and dynamic OOP language designed for developing reliable, high-performance applications across various platforms, including embedded systems and enterprise solutions. The course aims to equip students with skills to develop platform-independent Java applications for advanced technologies like three-tier architecture, cloud computing, web development, and hardware programming.

## 2. Competency

Develop Java applications using an object-oriented approach.

## 3. Course Outcomes (COs)

Students will demonstrate the following outcomes through practical exercises and theoretical knowledge:

- **a)** Write simple Java programs for given problem statements.
- **b)** Apply OOP concepts to solve real-world problems.
- **c)** Develop programs using inheritance and package concepts.
- **d)** Create programs incorporating multithreading and exception handling.
- **e)** Build programs using files and the collection framework.

## 4. Teaching and Examination Scheme

| Teaching Scheme (Hours) |  |  | Total Credits | Examination Scheme |  |  |  |  |
|-------------------------|------|------|---------------|--------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| Classroom (Cl) | Tutorial (T) | Practical (P) | (Cl + T/2 + P/2) | Theory CA | Theory ESE | Practical CA | Practical ESE | Total Marks |
| 3              | 0            | 4            | 5             | 30         | 70         | 25           | 25           | 150         |

**Note:** Theory Continuous Assessment (CA) includes 10 marks for a micro-project and 20 marks from two tests assessing cognitive domain outcomes.
