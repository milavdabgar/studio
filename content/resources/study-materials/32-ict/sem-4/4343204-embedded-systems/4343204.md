## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular
activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this
course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of each
activity.
- Prepare journals based on practical performed in laboratory.
ii) Prepare chart to represent the block diagram of different interfacing chips. Develop a
practical application using ATMega32 Microcontroller
iv) Prepare General purpose board with all ports available as connector
- Prepare/Download a dynamic animation to illustrate the following
- Timer operation                • Two Wire serial Interface (I2C)
- MAX 7221 Interfacing.          • DC Motor Interfacing

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- Some of the topics/sub-topics is relatively simple and very easy to the students for self-
learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.09, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions
for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine.
- Arrange visit to relevant industry
- Show video lectures on Microcontroller Applications with help of internet.
- Programming practices on simulators (free downloadable).

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-
based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so
that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to
be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which
## Practical Outcomes

```
are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated
work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less
than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit
micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
        A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and
the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.
- ICRO PROJECT 1: Prepare following Items.
```

1. Prepare Specification Table for AVR microcontroller family.
2. Design a chart of ATMega32 Architecture.

- IICRO PROJECT 2: Prepare following Designs.
1. Design minimum hardware system for ATMega32 circuit.
2. Develop ATMega32 based application board/circuit on PCB.

- ICRO PROJECT 3: Design Application oriented basic Project using ATMega32.
1. Design and Implement LED flasher circuit.
2. Design and Implement circuit for relay-based operation using switch.
3. Design and Implement Room Temperature Monitor/Controller System.
4. Design and Implement Water Level Indicator/controller circuit.
