## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned COs and PrOs.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of each activity.

- i)  Prepare journals based on practical performed in laboratory.
2. ii) Prepare chart to represent the block diagram of different interfacing chips. Develop a practical application using ATMega32 Microcontroller
3. iv) Prepare General purpose board with all ports available as connector
- v) Prepare/Download a dynamic animation to illustrate the following
- Timer operation                      â¢ Two Wire serial Interface (I2C)
- MAX 7221 Interfacing.          â¢ DC Motor Interfacing

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) Some of  the  topics/sub-topics is  relatively  simple and very easy to the students for selflearning , but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- d) With respect to section No.09 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- e) Guide students for using latest Technical Magazine.
- f) Arrange visit to relevant industry
- g) Show video lectures on Microcontroller Applications with help of internet.
- h) Programming practices on simulators (free downloadable).

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is groupbased.  However,  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters,  it  should  be  preferably  be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work  diary  consisting  of  individual  contribution  in  the  project  work  and  give  a  seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency   and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.

## MICRO PROJECT 1: Prepare following Items.

1. Prepare Specification Table for AVR microcontroller family.
2. Design a chart of ATMega32 Architecture.

## MIICRO PROJECT 2: Prepare following Designs.

1. Design minimum hardware system for ATMega32 circuit.
2. Develop ATMega32 based application board/circuit on PCB.

## MICRO PROJECT 3: Design Application oriented basic Project using ATMega32.

1. Design and Implement LED flasher circuit.
2. Design and Implement circuit for relay-based operation using switch.
3. Design and Implement Room Temperature Monitor/Controller System.
4. Design and Implement Water Level Indicator/controller circuit.
