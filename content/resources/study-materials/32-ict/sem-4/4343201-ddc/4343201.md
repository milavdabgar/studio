  The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of
  achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should gradually
  increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5
pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidence for their (student’s)
portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- Simulate the learned circuit using any circuit simulation software.
- Prepare Presentation on any one topic learned.
- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature can be
given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- Using different instructional methods for teaching.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her
in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group
of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not
exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop- based, laboratory-
based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an

integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of
individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission.
The total work load on each student due to the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student
engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit
micro project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with competency of the
course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- ASK, FSK, PSK, QPSK and QAM Modulator and Demodulator: Implement a simple various
    digital modulator and demodulator using a microcontroller /PYTHON/MATLAB
- ASK, FSK, PSK, QPSK and QAM Modulator and Demodulator Wireless Communication:
- Develop a wireless communication system using various digital modulator and demodulator
- Implement source coding techniques like Arithmetic coding, Run-Length Encoding, Delta coding
- Implement channel coding techniques like error correction code, Convolution Coding and
    Viterbi Decoding, Turbo Codes, BCH code, LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) Codes
- Serial Communication with Python
- Serial Bluetooth Communication
- Parallel Data Transfer using General Purpose Input/output (GPIO)
- 5G Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output): Build a micro project that demonstrates the
    benefits of Massive MIMO in 5G.
- Satellite Ground Station Setup: Create a satellite ground station using a software-defined radio
- SDR) or other communication equipment
- Orbital Mechanics Simulation: Develop a simulation program that models satellite orbits using
    basic orbital mechanics equations
- LEO, MEO and GEO satellite model tracker
