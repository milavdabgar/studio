## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  student  related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this  course:  Students  should  perform  following  activities  in  group  and  prepare  reports  of  about  5 pages  for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record  physical  evidence  for  their  (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

-  Simulate the learned circuit using any circuit simulation software.
-  Prepare Presentation on any one topic learned.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These  are  sample  strategies,  which  the  teacher  can  use  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the  various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) About  20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics  which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in  nature  can  be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- d) Using different instructional methods for teaching.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop- based, laboratorybased or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total  work  load  on  each  student  due  to  the  micro-project  should  be  about  16  (sixteen)  student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit micro project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is  given  here. This  should  relate  highly  with  competency  of  the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- ASK, FSK, PSK, QPSK and QAM Modulator and Demodulator: Implement a simple various digital modulator and demodulator using a microcontroller /PYTHON/MATLAB
-  ASK, FSK, PSK, QPSK and QAM Modulator and Demodulator Wireless Communication: Develop a wireless communication system using various digital modulator and demodulator
- Implement source coding techniques like Arithmetic coding, Run-Length Encoding, Delta coding
- Implement channel coding techniques like   error correction code, Convolution Coding and Viterbi Decoding, Turbo Codes, BCH code, LDPC (Low-Density Parity-Check) Codes
- Serial Communication with Python
- Serial Bluetooth Communication
- Parallel Data Transfer using General Purpose Input/output (GPIO)
- 5G Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output): Build a micro project that demonstrates the benefits of Massive MIMO in 5G.
- Satellite Ground Station Setup: Create a satellite ground station using a software-defined radio (SDR) or other communication equipment
- Orbital Mechanics Simulation: Develop a simulation program that models satellite orbits using basic orbital mechanics equations
- LEO, MEO and GEO satellite model tracker
