## Question 1(a) [3 marks]

**Explain packet switching network.**

**Answer**:
Packet switching is a network communication method where data is divided into small packets before transmission.

**Diagram:**

```mermaid

    A[Source] --> B[Packets Created]
    B --> C[Packet 1]
    B --> D[Packet 2]
    B --> E[Packet 3]
    C --> F[Router]
    D --> F
    E --> F
    F --> G[Different paths]
    G --> H[Destination]
```
