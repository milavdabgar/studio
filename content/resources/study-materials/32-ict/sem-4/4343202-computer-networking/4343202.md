8. Invite industry experts to deliver guest lectures on current trends, challenges, and best practices in computer networks and data communication.

## 11. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.
