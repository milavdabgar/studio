8. Invite industry experts to deliver guest lectures on current trends, challenges, and best practices in computer networks and data communication.

## 11. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher.

### Suggested Micro-Projects

1. Dynamic Cloud Network Control Under Reconfiguration Delay and Cost
2. Measuring Web Latency and Rendering Performance
3. Configuration to a DHCP Server
4. Implement and Verify Static Routes
5. Connectivity Tests with Traceroute
6. Configure Dynamic NAT using Packet Tracer
7. Configure Switch and Router VTY, Privilege and enable Password Assignment
