## 1. Rationale

This course is an extension of the course based on Mathematics of first semester namely
Engineering Mathematics. The course is designed to inculcate its applications in relevant
branch of engineering and technology using the techniques of Differentiation, Integration,
Differential equations, Matrix theory and Complex numbers. Calculus is a branch of
Mathematics that calculates how matter, particles and heavenly bodies actually move. With
calculus, we can find how the changing conditions of a system affect us, we can control a
system. Derivatives are useful to find maxima and minima of the function, velocity and
acceleration and also useful for many engineering optimization problems. Definite integrals
are a powerful tool to help us realize and model the world around us. Differential
equations are widely applied to model natural phenomena, engineering systems and many
other situations. Matrix analysis is a valuable tool used in nearly all the engineering sciences.
Complex numbers, is one of the most elegant and interesting topics in mathematics. Complex
numbers, their algebra and geometry has always been an important tool to crack thousands
of the problems based on Pure and Applied Mathematics. In fact, some properties are easier
in complex than real variables. DeMoivre’s Theorem is one of the most important and useful
theorems which connects complex numbers and trigonometry and also helpful for obtaining
relationships between trigonometric functions of multiple angles. This course further
develops the skills and understanding of mathematical concepts which underpin the
investigative tools used for modeling and analysis in a wide range of applications in
engineering.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Solve broad-based technology problems using the principles of engineering
mathematics.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare

Engineering Mathematics                                                           Course Code: 4320002

reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their
(student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Identify engineering problems based on real world problems relevant to content of the
unit and solve these problems in the light of free tutorials available on the internet.
- Explore the opportunity to visit Science city, ISRO or nearby Science centers.
- Explore the opportunity to visit Mathematics Lab Virtually.
- Prepare charts showing formulas of differentiation.
- Prepare charts showing formulas of integrations.
- Use Graphing calculator to plot the graph of solutions explaining Engineering
applications.
- Communicate mathematical thinking coherently and clearly to other students, peers,
and others.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessedusing different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Explore the possibility for understanding the Biosphere through Mathematics.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are
group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14-16
(fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to
submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Charts: Prepare the Charts of formulae for Matrix, Differentiation, Integration, Complex
       Numbers.
- Charts: Compare last weather conditions with current weather to predict future weather
       through chart.
- Models: Prepare the cardboard models based on real world applications of derivatives.

- Presentation/Seminar: Prepare a presentation/seminar on any relevant topic of
         interdisciplinary nature.
- History of Mathematics: Prepare a write up on the Historical path of Calculus.
- Solution of system of linear equations: Form the system of linear equations up to
         three variables for the given electrical circuit using matrices and solve it.
- Maxima and Minima: Find a real-world problem related to finding area/volume, form
         the corresponding function and find maxima/minima. For example, maximize the
         volume of a box made of a rectangle tin sheet by cutting off squares of same size from
         each corner and folding up.
- Slope of tangent: Find the slope of tangent for the given curves at a given point using
         derivative and verify using suitable software.
- Area/Volume: Find the area of a given closed regain or volume of revolution for a given
         function using integration and verify using suitable software.
- Solution of Differential equation: Form differential equations for real-world problems
         and plot the graph using suitable software with geometrical interpretation.
- Geometrical representation of complex numbers: Formulate the geometrical
         representation of addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. and explain using suitable
