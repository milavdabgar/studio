  "rationale": "This course is an extension of the course based on Mathematics of first semester namely Engineering Mathematics. The course is designed to inculcate its applications in relevant branch of engineering and technology using the techniques of Differentiation, Integration, Differential equations, Matrix theory and Complex numbers.\n\nCalculus is a branch of Mathematics that calculates how matter, particles and heavenly bodies actually move. With calculus, we can find how the changing conditions of a system affect us, we can control a system. Derivatives are useful to find maxima and minima of the function, velocity and acceleration and also useful for many engineering optimization problems.\n\nDefinite integrals are a powerful tool to help us realize and model the world around us. Differential equations are widely applied to model natural phenomena, engineering systems and many other situations. Matrix analysis is a valuable tool used in nearly all the engineering sciences.\n\nComplex numbers, is one of the most elegant and interesting topics in mathematics. Complex numbers, their algebra and geometry has always been an important tool to crack thousands of the problems based on Pure and Applied Mathematics. In fact, some properties are easier in complex than real variables. DeMoivre's Theorem is one of the most important and useful theorems which connects complex numbers and trigonometry and also helpful for obtaining relationships between trigonometric functions of multiple angles.\n\nThis course further develops the skills and understanding of mathematical concepts which underpin the investigative tools used for modeling and analysis in a wide range of applications in engineering.",
