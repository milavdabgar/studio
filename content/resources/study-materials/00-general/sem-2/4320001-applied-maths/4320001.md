Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)
Semester -II

Course Title: Applied Mathematics

Diploma programmes in which this course is offered        Semester in which offered
Chemical Engineering, Civil Engineering, Marine Engineering,
Second
Mechanical Engineering, Mining Engineering

## 1. Rationale

This course is an extension of the course based on Mathematics of first semester namely
Applied Mathematics. The course is designed to inculcate its applications in relevant branch
of engineering and technology using the techniques of Differentiation, Integration,
Differential equations, Matrix theory and Statistics. Calculus is a branch of Mathematics that
calculates how matter, particles and heavenly bodies actually move. With calculus, we can
find how the changing conditions of a system affect us, we can control a system. Derivatives
are useful to find maxima and minima of the function, velocity and acceleration and also useful
for many engineering optimization problems. Definite integrals are a powerful tool to help us
realize and model the world around us. Differential equations are widely applied to model
natural phenomena, engineering systems and many other situations. Matrix analysis is a
valuable tool used in nearly all the engineering sciences. Statistics can be defined as a type of
mathematical analysis which involves the method of collecting and analyzing data and then
summing up the data into a numerical form for a given set of factual data or real-world
observations. This course further develops the skills and understanding of mathematical
concepts which underpin the investigative tools used for modeling and analysis in a wide range
of applications in engineering.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Solve broad-based technology problems using the principles of Applied
mathematics.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of
the following COs:
- Demonstrate the ability to Crack engineering related problems based on Matrices.
- Demonstrate the ability to solve engineering related problems based on applications
of differentiation.
- Demonstrate the ability to solve engineering related problems based on applications
of integration.
- Develop the ability to apply differential equations to significant applied problems.
- Solve applied problems using the concept of mean.

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
- Realize importance of green Mathematics.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If required, more
such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher
to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare
reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their
(student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Identify engineering problems based on real world problems relevant to content of the
unit and solve these problems in the light of free tutorials available on the internet.
- Explore the opportunity to visit Science city, ISRO or nearby Science centers.
- Explore the opportunity to visit Mathematics Lab Virtually.
- Prepare charts showing formulas of differentiation.
- Prepare charts showing formulas of integrations.
- Use Graphing calculator to plot the graph of solutions explaining Engineering
applications.
- Communicate mathematical thinking coherently and clearly to other students, peers,
and others.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Explore the possibility for understanding the Biosphere through Mathematics.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are
group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to
submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Charts: Prepare the Charts of formulae for Matrix, Differentiation, Integration.
- Charts: Compare last weather conditions with current weather to predict future weather
       through chart.
- Models: Prepare the cardboard models based on real world applications of derivatives.
- Presentation/Seminar: Prepare a presentation/seminar on any relevant topic of
       interdisciplinary nature.
- History of Mathematics: Prepare a write up on the Historical path of Calculus.
- Solution of system of linear equations: Form the system of linear equations up to
       three variables for the given electrical circuit using matrices solve it.
- Maxima and Minima: Find a real-world problem related to finding area/volume, form
       the corresponding function and find maxima/minima. For example, maximize the
       volume of a box made of a rectangle tin sheet by cutting off squares of same size from
       each corner and folding up.
- Slope of tangent: Find the slope of tangent for the given curves at a given point using
       derivative and visualize the location using suitable software.
- Area/Volume: Find the area of a given closed region or volume of revolution for a given
       function using integration and visualize using suitable software.
- Solution of Differential equation: Form differential equations for real-world problems
       and plot the graph using suitable software with geometrical interpretation.
- Statistics: Collect the data of world of work and find mean, mean deviation and
       standard deviation for that data.
