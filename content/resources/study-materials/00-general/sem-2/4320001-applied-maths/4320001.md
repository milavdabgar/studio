## 1. RATIONALE

This course is an extension of the course based on Mathematics of first semester namely Applied Mathematics. The course is designed to inculcate its applications in relevant branch of engineering and technology using the techniques of Differentiation, Integration, Differential equations, Matrix theory and Statistics.

Calculus is a branch of Mathematics that calculates how matter, particles and heavenly bodies actually move. With calculus, we can find how the changing conditions of a system affect us, we can control a system. Derivatives are useful to find maxima and minima of the function, velocity and acceleration and also useful for many engineering optimization problems.

Definite integrals are a powerful tool to help us realize and model the world around us. Differential equations are widely applied to model natural phenomena, engineering systems and many other situations. Matrix analysis is a valuable tool used in nearly all the engineering sciences.

Statistics can be defined as a type of mathematical analysis which involves the method of collecting and analyzing data and then summing up the data into a numerical form for a given set of factual data or real-world observations. This course further develops the skills and understanding of mathematical concepts which underpin the investigative tools used for modeling and analysis in a wide range of applications in engineering.

## 2. COMPETENCY

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to  5).  However, in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters ,  the  number  of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Charts: Prepare the Charts of formulae for Matrix, Differentiation, Integration.
- b) Charts: Compare last weather conditions with current weather to predict future weather through chart.
- c) Models: Prepare the cardboard models based on real world applications of derivatives.
