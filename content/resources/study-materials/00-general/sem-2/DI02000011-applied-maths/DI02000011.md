| Academic Year | Semester | Category |
|---------------|----------|-----------|
| w.e.f. 2024 | 2nd | BSC |

### Prerequisites

Function, Logarithm, Determinant, Trigonometry, Limit, Factorization, Polynomial, Quadratic Equation, Coordinate Geometry, LCM, GCD, Concept of Set.

### Rationale

This course is an extension of the course Mathematics-I of first semester namely Applied Mathematics. The course is designed to inculcate its applications in relevant branch of engineering and technology using the techniques of Differentiation, Integration, Differential equations, Matrix theory and Statistics.

The course is structured with an emphasis on multidisciplinary learning and skill development, ensuring that students can apply mathematical techniques and concepts effectively in their vocational and technical areas. Its elements are designed to be thorough, hands-on, and aligned with both academic standards and professional expectations.

## Course Outcomes

After completion of the course, students will be able to:

| No. | Course Outcomes | RBT Level |
