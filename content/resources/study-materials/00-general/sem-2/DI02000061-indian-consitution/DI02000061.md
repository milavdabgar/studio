## Suggested Special Instructional Strategies (If Any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

1. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics
2. Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects
3. 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes
4. About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods
5. With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities
6. Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability
