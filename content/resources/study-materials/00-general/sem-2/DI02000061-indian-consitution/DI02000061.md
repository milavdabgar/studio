## Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the above mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfil  the  development  of  this  course t competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow constitutional duties and responsibilities
- c) Follow ethical practices.
- d) Practice environmental friendly methods and processes.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy'  should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If  required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.
