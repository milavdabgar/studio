5. SUGGESTED Soft PRACTICAL EXERCISES (During Theory)
The entrepreneurial or start-up journey begins by readying for your future dream from college
projects and pursuing the same beyond college hours also. It is encouraged to go through COs and
identify traits and search for various state and national agencies for your entrepreneurship / start-
up journey and convert the same into successful product in market.

## Practical Outcomes

```
The following practical outcomes (SPrOs) are the sub-components of the Course Outcomes (COs).
Some of the SPrOs marked ‘*’ are compulsory, as they are crucial for that particular CO at the
- Precision Level’ of Dave’s Taxonomy related to ‘Psychomotor Domain’.
Note
- Though the course does not contain any Practical work, a few Practical Exercises can be designed
    and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to
    match the COs. The below table is only a suggestive list.

ii. The following are some sample ‘Process’ and ‘Product’ related skills (more may be added/deleted
    depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises of this course required
    which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this course
competency.

- Work as a leader/a team member (while doing a micro-project).
- Model behavioral practices of an entrepreneur while planning for an enterprise
- Practice ethics and consider methods/ processes that reduce waste and/or possibly conserve
        environment in designing a new business till it’s commercialization.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of
achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should gradually
increase as planned below:

## 7. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If required, more such
- Os could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.
