## 5. SUGGESTED Soft PRACTICAL EXERCISES (During Theory)

The  entrepreneurial  or  start-up  journey  begins  by  readying  for  your  future  dream  from  college projects and pursuing the same beyond college hours also. It is encouraged to go through COs and identify traits and search for various state and national agencies for your entrepreneurship / startup journey and convert the same into successful product in market.

The following practical outcomes (SPrOs) are the sub-components of the Course Outcomes (COs). Some  of  the SPrOs marked '*' are  compulsory,  as  they  are  crucial  for  that  particular  CO  at  the 'Precision Level' of Dave's Taxonomy related to 'Psychomotor Domain'.

## Note

- i. Though the course does not contain any Practical work, a few Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The below table is only a suggestive list .
- ii. The following are some sample 'Process' and 'Product' related skills (more may be added/deleted depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises of this course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

## 6. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the  abovementioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this  course competency.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st year-Planning
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year-Model Development
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year-Make it Scalable

## 7. UNDERPINNING THEORY
