  "rationale": "Physics is branch of science mainly deals with interaction of energy and matter and considered as the mother of all engineering disciplines. Diploma engineers (technologists) have to deal with various materials while using/ maintaining machines. More over the basic knowledge of principles of physics helps diploma students to lay foundations of core engineering courses. The laws and principles of physics, formulae and knowledge of physical phenomena and physical properties provides a means of estimating the behavior of things before we design and observe them. This course of physics has been designed as per program requirements to help students to study the relevant core engineering courses. The complicated derivations have been avoided and micro projects are introduced. This course will help the diploma engineers to use/apply the basic concepts and principles of physics solve well designed engineering problems and comprehend different technology-based applications.",
