## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Derive SI unit of work and Velocity using fundamental physical units.**

**Answer**:

**Table: Derivation of Work and Velocity Units**

| Physical Quantity | Formula | SI Unit Derivation | SI Unit |
|------------------|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Work (W) | W = F × d | W = [Force] × [Distance] = [kg·m/s²] × [m] = [kg·m²/s²] | Joule (J) |

## Question 5(c) [7 marks]

**Explain Total internal reflection of light. And derive the equation of critical angle.**

**Answer**:

**Total Internal Reflection (TIR)**: The complete reflection of light at the boundary between two media when light travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium at an angle greater than the critical angle.

**Conditions for TIR**:

1. Light must travel from denser to rarer medium
2. Angle of incidence must exceed critical angle

**Critical Angle**: The angle of incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction in the rarer medium is 90°.

**Derivation**:
Using Snell's law: n₁sin(θ₁) = n₂sin(θ₂)

At critical angle (θc):

- θ₁ = θc
- θ₂ = 90°
- sin(90°) = 1

Therefore:
n₁sin(θc) = n₂sin(90°) = n₂ × 1 = n₂

Rearranging:
sin(θc) = n₂/n₁

**Answer**:

**Optical Fiber Construction**:

1. **Core**: Central light-transmitting portion (glass or plastic)
2. **Cladding**: Surrounds core, with lower refractive index than core
3. **Buffer Coating**: Protective plastic coating
4. **Jacket**: Outer protective covering

**Step Index Fiber**:

- Abrupt change in refractive index between core and cladding
- Light travels in zigzag path by total internal reflection
- Higher modal dispersion (signal spreading)
- Simpler construction

**Graded Index Fiber**:

- Gradual change in refractive index from center of core to cladding
- Light travels in helical path due to continuous refraction
- Lower modal dispersion
- More complex construction
