## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**The length of a metal rod is 64.522 cm at 12°C temperature and 64.576 cm at 90°C temperature. Find the coefficient of linear expansion of the metal rod.**

**Answer**:
**Formula:** α = (L₂ - L₁)/[L₁ × (T₂ - T₁)]

**Calculation:**

- Initial length (L₁) = 64.522 cm
- Final length (L₂) = 64.576 cm
- Initial temperature (T₁) = 12°C
- Final temperature (T₂) = 90°C

α = (64.576 - 64.522)/[64.522 × (90 - 12)]
α = 0.054/(64.522 × 78)
α = 0.054/5032.716

## Question 2(a) [3 marks]

**Find the diameter of a sphere if pitch of micrometer screw gauge is 1 mm and there are 100 divisions on circular scale. The edge of circular scale lies between 7 and 8 mm of the main scale and 65th division of the circular scale coincides with the horizontal line of the main scale.**

**Answer**:
**Formula:** Diameter = Main scale reading + (Circular scale reading × Least count)

**Calculation:**

- Main scale reading = 7 mm
- Circular scale reading = 65 divisions
- Least count = Pitch/Number of divisions = 1/100 = 0.01 mm

Diameter = 7 + (65 × 0.01) = 7 + 0.65 = 7.65 mm

## Question 2(a) OR [3 marks]

**If the lengths of two cylinders are (6.52±0.01) cm and (4.48±0.02) cm respectively. Find the difference in their length with percentage error.**

**Answer**:
**Calculation:**

- Length of first cylinder (L₁) = 6.52 ± 0.01 cm
- Length of second cylinder (L₂) = 4.48 ± 0.02 cm
- Difference in length (ΔL) = L₁ - L₂ = 6.52 - 4.48 = 2.04 cm

**Absolute error in difference** = √[(0.01)² + (0.02)²] = √(0.0001 + 0.0004) = √0.0005 = 0.022 cm

**Percentage error** = (Absolute error/Measured value) × 100
                    = (0.022/2.04) × 100 = 1.08%

## Question 4(a) [3 marks]

**The electric force between two positive ions of equal magnitude separated by distance 5×10⁻¹⁰ m from eachother is 3.7 × 10⁻⁹ N. How many electrons would have been removed from each atom.**

**Answer**:
**Formula:** F = (1/4πε₀) × (q₁q₂/r²)

**Calculation:**

- F = 3.7 × 10⁻⁹ N
- r = 5 × 10⁻¹⁰ m
- q₁ = q₂ = ne (n = number of electrons, e = electron charge)

**Calculate the numerical aperture and acceptance angle of an optical fibre if the refractive indices of core and cladding of an optical fibre are 1.55 and 1.5 respectively.**

**Answer**:
**Formulas:**

- Numerical Aperture (NA) = √(n₁² - n₂²)
- Acceptance angle (θₐ) = sin⁻¹(NA)

**Calculation:**

- Core refractive index (n₁) = 1.55
- Cladding refractive index (n₂) = 1.5

NA = √(1.55² - 1.5²)
NA = √(2.4025 - 2.25)
NA = √0.1525
NA = 0.391

Acceptance angle (θₐ) = sin⁻¹(0.391)
θₐ = 23.03°

## Question 5(a) OR [3 marks]

**Give a detailed explanation of specific heat.**

**Answer**:
**Specific Heat:**
Amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 kg of a substance by 1 Kelvin (or 1°C).

**Formula:** Q = mc∆T

Where:

- Q = Heat energy (J)
- m = Mass (kg)
- c = Specific heat capacity (J/kg·K)
- ∆T = Temperature change (K)

**Units:** J/kg·K or J/kg·°C

**Significance:**

- Measures thermal inertia of materials
- Higher specific heat means material requires more energy to heat up
- Water has unusually high specific heat (4,186 J/kg·K)

**Mnemonic:** "STEM: Specific heat measures Temperature change per Energy and Mass"

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**If the refractive indices of core and cladding of an optical fibre are 1.48 and 1.45 respectively. Calculate its acceptance angle and critical angle.**

**Answer**:
**Formulas:**

- Numerical Aperture (NA) = √(n₁² - n₂²)
- Acceptance angle (θₐ) = sin⁻¹(NA)
- Critical angle (θc) = sin⁻¹(n₂/n₁)

**Calculation:**

- Core refractive index (n₁) = 1.48
- Cladding refractive index (n₂) = 1.45

NA = √(1.48² - 1.45²)
NA = √(2.1904 - 2.1025)
NA = √0.0879
NA = 0.296

Acceptance angle (θₐ) = sin⁻¹(0.296)
θₐ = 17.2°

Critical angle (θc) = sin⁻¹(n₂/n₁)
θc = sin⁻¹(1.45/1.48)
θc = sin⁻¹(0.9797)
θc = 78.4°

**Mnemonic:** "NA leads to AA, ratio leads to Critical Angle"
