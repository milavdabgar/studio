## 1. Rationale

Physics is branch of science mainly deals with interaction of energy and matter and
considered as the mother of all engineering disciplines. Diploma engineers (technologists)
have to deal with various materials while using/ maintaining machines. More over the basic
knowledge of principles of physics helps diploma students to lay foundations of core
engineering courses. The laws and principles of physics, formulae and knowledge of physical
phenomena and physical properties provides a means of estimating the behavior of
things before we design and observe them. This course of physics has been designed as
per program requirements to help students to study the relevant core engineering
courses. The complicated derivations have been avoided and micro projects are introduced.
This course will help the diploma engineers to use/apply the basic concepts and principles of
physics solve well designed engineering problems and comprehend different technology-
based applications.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Use principles of physics to solve broadly defined engineering problems.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:
- Use relevant instruments with precision to measure the dimension of given physical
quantities in various engineering situations.
- Apply the concepts of electrostatics and capacitance for engineering applications.
- Apply the basic concepts of heat transfer and thermometric properties to provide
solutions for various engineering problems.
- Use the concept of waves and sound waves for various engineering applications
involving wave dynamics.
- Use the concepts of LASER and Fiber optics for various engineering applications.

    above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
    competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
- Follow safe practices
- Handle equipment carefully
- Practice energy saving processes.
- Practice environmentally friendly methods and processes. (Environment related)

    The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
    level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
    should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
        ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare small reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record
physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student’s) portfolio
which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare model to demonstrate concepts of physics
- Undertake micro-projects in teams
- Give seminar on any relevant topic.
- Measure physical quantities using smart phone.
- Prepare showcase portfolios.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the
knowledge of this course

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give
a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be
about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course.The students
ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-
oriented COs).

       A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with
competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the
concerned course teacher:
- Measurement: Measure physical quantities using smart phone applications.
- Prepare proto type Vernier calipers of given least count.
- Arduino: Physical quantities such as Voltage, Magnetic field, Temperature, Light,
       Sound and distance can be measured with the help of low-cost sensors and Arduino.
- Paper Capacitor: Aluminum foil and tissue paper can be used to make cylindrical
       capacitor.
- Variable capacitor: Two copper cylinders and plastic pipe can be used to make
       variable capacitor.
- Sugar and bending of light: prepare a solution of sugar and water to demonstrate
       bending of light (using semiconductor LASER).
- Fiber optics: prepare an optical fiber cable using transparent flexible plastic tube,
       laser and water to demonstrate the property of optical fiber cable.
