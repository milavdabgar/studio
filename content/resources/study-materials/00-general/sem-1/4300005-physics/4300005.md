## 1. RATIONALE

Physics  is  branch  of  science  mainly  deals  with  interaction  of  energy  and  matter  and considered as the mother of all engineering disciplines. Diploma  engineers (technologists) have to deal with various materials while using/ maintaining machines. More over the basic knowledge  of  principles  of  physics  helps  diploma  students  to  lay  foundations  of  core engineering courses. The laws and principles of physics, formulae and knowledge of physical phenomena  and  physical  properties  provides  a  means  of  estimating  the  behavior  of things  before  we  design  and  observe  them.  This  course  of  physics  has  been  designed  as per  program  requirements  to  help  students  to  study  the  relevant  core  engineering courses. The complicated derivations have been avoided and micro projects are introduced. This course will help the diploma engineers to use/apply the basic concepts and principles of physics  solve  well  designed  engineering  problems  and  comprehend  different  technologybased applications.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

- Use principles of physics to solve broadly defined engineering problems.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

- a) Use relevant instruments with precision to measure the dimension of given physical quantities in various engineering situations.

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfil  the  development  of  this competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.
- c) Follow safe practices
- d) Handle equipment carefully
- e) Practice energy saving processes.
- f) Practice environmentally friendly methods and processes. (Environment related)

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises.  Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

The  major  underpinning  theory  is  given  below  based  on  the  higher  level  UOs  of Revised Bloom's  taxonomy that  are  formulated  for  development  of  the  COs  and  competency.  If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various  outcomes in this  course:  Students  should  conduct  following activities  in  group  and prepare  small  reports  of  about    5  pages  for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record physical evidences such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare model to demonstrate concepts of physics
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give seminar on any relevant topic.
- d) Measure physical quantities using smart phone.
- e) Prepare showcase portfolios.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive  open  online  courses  (MOOCs)  may  be  used  to  teach  various  topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- f) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industryoriented COs).

Physics                                                                                                                                                                                 Course Code: 4300005

A  suggestive  list  of  micro-projects  is  given  here.  This  should  relate  highly  with competency  of  the  course  and  the  COs.  Similar  micro-projects  could  be  added  by  the concerned course teacher:

- a) Measurement: Measure physical quantities using smart phone applications.
- b) Prepare proto type Vernier calipers of given least count.
- c) Arduino : Physical  quantities  such  as  Voltage,  Magnetic  field,  Temperature,  Light, Sound and distance can be measured with the help of low-cost sensors and Arduino.
- d) Paper  Capacitor:  Aluminum  foil  and  tissue  paper  can  be  used  to  make  cylindrical capacitor.
- e) Variable  capacitor:  Two  copper  cylinders  and  plastic  pipe  can  be  used  to  make variable capacitor.
- f) Sugar and bending of light: prepare a solution of sugar and water to demonstrate bending of light (using semiconductor LASER).
- g) Fiber  optics:  prepare  an  optical  fiber  cable  using  transparent  flexible  plastic  tube, laser and water to demonstrate the property of optical fiber cable.
