## Question 1(c)(i) [4 marks] (OR)

**How are absolute and relative errors calculated?**

**Answer**:

**Absolute Error (Δa)**: Difference between measured value and true value

- For multiple measurements, it's difference between measured value and mean value

**Calculation of Absolute Error**:

- **Single measurement**: Δa = |Measured value - True value|
- **Multiple measurements**: 
  1. Calculate mean (am)

  3. Mean absolute error: Δa = (Δa1 + Δa2 + ... + Δan) ÷ n

**Relative Error (εr)**: Ratio of absolute error to true value

- εr = Absolute error ÷ True value = Δa ÷ True value

**Percentage Error (εp)**: Relative error expressed as percentage

- εp = Relative error × 100 = (Δa ÷ True value) × 100%

**Mnemonic:** "Absolute Always measures Actual deviation; Relative References the total value"

## Question 2(c)(i) [4 marks]

**Derive formula for equivalent capacitance of capacitors connected in series and parallel combination.**

**Answer**:

**For Series Combination**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["\+"] --- B[C₁]
    B --- C[C₂]
    C --- D[C₃]
    D --- E["\-"]
```

When capacitors are connected in series:

- Same charge Q appears on each capacitor
- Potential difference distributes across capacitors
- V = V₁ + V₂ + V₃

For each capacitor: V₁ = Q/C₁, V₂ = Q/C₂, V₃ = Q/C₃

Total voltage: V = Q/C₁ + Q/C₂ + Q/C₃ = Q(1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃)

For equivalent capacitance: V = Q/Ceq

Therefore: 1/Ceq = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃

**For Parallel Combination**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A["\+"] --- B[C₁]
    A --- C[C₂]
    A --- D[C₃]
    B --- E["\-"]
    C --- E
    D --- E
```

When capacitors are connected in parallel:

- Same potential difference V across each capacitor
- Total charge distributes among capacitors
- Q = Q₁ + Q₂ + Q₃

For each capacitor: Q₁ = C₁V, Q₂ = C₂V, Q₃ = C₃V

Total charge: Q = C₁V + C₂V + C₃V = (C₁ + C₂ + C₃)V

For equivalent capacitance: Q = CeqV

Therefore: Ceq = C₁ + C₂ + C₃

**Mnemonic:** "Series Sums Reciprocals, Parallel Puts Capacitance Together"

## Question 2(c)(ii) [2 marks]

**Calculation**:
Ceq = 8 μF + 9 μF = 17 μF

**Therefore, equivalent capacitance = 17 μF**

**Answer**:

**Formula**: Q = (K × A × t × ΔT)/L

**Given**:

- Area (A) = 0.5 m²
- Thickness (L) = 0.6 cm = 0.006 m
- Inside temperature (T₁) = 30°C
- Outside temperature (T₂) = 20°C
- Temperature difference (ΔT) = 10°C = 10 K
- Coefficient of thermal conductivity (K) = 1.0 W/m·K
- Time (t) = 1 hour = 3600 seconds

**Calculation**:
Q = (1.0 × 0.5 × 3600 × 10)/0.006
Q = (18000)/0.006

## Question 3(c)(i) [4 marks] (OR)

**Define linear thermal expansion of solids and derive formula of coefficient linear thermal expansion.**

**Answer**:

**Linear Thermal Expansion**:
Increase in length of a solid material when its temperature increases

**Coefficient of Linear Thermal Expansion (α)**:
Fractional change in length per unit change in temperature

**Derivation**:

For small temperature changes:

- Change in length (ΔL) is directly proportional to original length (L₀)
- ΔL is directly proportional to change in temperature (ΔT)

Therefore: ΔL ∝ L₀ × ΔT

Converting to equation with proportionality constant α:
ΔL = α × L₀ × ΔT

Rearranging:
α = ΔL/(L₀ × ΔT)

Where:

- ΔL = Change in length (in meters)
- L₀ = Original length (in meters)
- ΔT = Change in temperature (in Kelvin or Celsius)
- α = Coefficient of linear thermal expansion (per °C or per K)

**Answer**:

**Formula**: L = L₀(1 + αΔT)

**Given**:

- Original length (L₀) = 150 cm
- Original temperature = 0°C
- Final temperature = 200°C
- Temperature change (ΔT) = 200°C
- Coefficient of linear expansion (α) = 12 × 10⁻⁶ per °C

**Calculation**:
L = 150(1 + 12 × 10⁻⁶ × 200)
L = 150(1 + 24 × 10⁻⁴)
L = 150(1 + 0.0024)
L = 150 × 1.0024
L = 150.36 cm

## Question 4(c)(i) [5 marks] (OR)

**How is ultrasonic wave produced using magnetostriction method?**

    A[Oscillator] --> B[Amplifier]
    B --> C[Coil around Ferromagnetic Rod]
    C --> D[Magnetostrictive Rod Vibrations]
    D --> E[Ultrasonic Waves]
```

**Working Principle**:

1. Based on magnetostriction effect - dimensional change in ferromagnetic materials when placed in magnetic field
2. When magnetic field is applied, rod contracts
3. When field is removed, rod expands back to original size
4. Alternating current creates alternating magnetic field
5. Rod vibrates at frequency of applied current
6. These vibrations generate ultrasonic waves

**Components**:

- **Oscillator**: Generates high-frequency electrical oscillations
- **Amplifier**: Increases amplitude of oscillations
- **Coil**: Creates magnetic field when current passes
- **Ferromagnetic rod**: Nickel, iron-nickel alloy, or ferrites
- **Mounting**: Supports rod properly

**Frequency Range**: 20 kHz to 100 kHz (lower than piezoelectric method)

**Advantages**:

- Handles high power
- Suitable for high-intensity applications
- Rugged construction
- Works well at lower frequencies

**Limitations**:

- Limited to lower frequencies
- Lower efficiency than piezoelectric method
- Heating of rod at high frequencies

## Question 5(c)(i) [5 marks]

**What is importance of population inversion and metastable state for production of LASER?**

**Answer**:

**Population Inversion**:

- **Definition**: State where more atoms are in excited state than in ground state (reverse of normal equilibrium)
- **Importance**:
  1. Essential condition for laser action to occur
  2. Creates environment for stimulated emission to dominate over absorption
  3. Enables amplification of light (negative absorption)
  4. Without it, emitted photons would be absorbed, preventing laser action
  5. Required for chain reaction of stimulated emission

**Diagram**:

```
Normal:              Population Inversion:
  -----                  -----
  |   | Few atoms        ||||||| Many atoms
  -----                  -----
     ↑                      ↓
     |                      |
  -----                  -----
  ||||||| Many atoms     |   | Few atoms
  -----                  -----
Ground state          Ground state
```

**Metastable State**:

- **Definition**: Excited energy state with relatively long lifetime (10⁻³ to 10⁻⁷ seconds)
- **Importance**:
  1. Allows accumulation of excited atoms (temporary energy reservoir)
  2. Provides time for population inversion to establish
  3. Long lifetime prevents rapid spontaneous emission
  4. Ensures stimulated emission dominates over spontaneous emission
  5. Essential for continuous laser operation

  E₃ ----|---- Short-lived excited state
          |

## Question 5(c)(i) [5 marks] (OR)

**Derive formula for numerical aperture and angle of acceptance of optical fibre.**

**Answer**:

**Numerical Aperture (NA) Derivation**:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Consider Critical Angle at Core-Cladding Interface] --> B[Apply Snell's Law]
    B --> C[Relate to Angle of Acceptance]
    C --> D[Derive NA Formula]
```

**Step 1**: Consider critical angle (θc) at core-cladding interface

- At critical angle, refracted ray grazes along interface
- sin(θc) = n₂/n₁ (where n₁ = core index, n₂ = cladding index)

**Step 2**: For a ray traveling in core, apply condition for total internal reflection

- Ray must strike at angle greater than critical angle
- Maximum angle in core: 90° - θc

**Step 3**: For ray entering from air (n₀ = 1), apply Snell's law

- n₀sin(θₐ) = n₁sin(θ₁)
- sin(θₐ) = n₁sin(θ₁)
- Where θₐ is acceptance angle

**Step 4**: Use maximum value of θ₁ (90° - θc)

- sin(θₐ) = n₁sin(90° - θc) = n₁cos(θc)

**Step 5**: Substitute sin(θc) = n₂/n₁

- cos(θc) = √(1 - sin²(θc)) = √(1 - (n₂/n₁)²)

**Step 6**: Therefore:

- sin(θₐ) = n₁√(1 - (n₂/n₁)²) = √(n₁² - n₂²)

**Final Formula**:

- Numerical Aperture (NA) = sin(θₐ) = √(n₁² - n₂²)
- Where θₐ is angle of acceptance
