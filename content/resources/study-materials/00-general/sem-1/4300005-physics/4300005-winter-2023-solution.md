Consider a wave traveling with:

- Wavelength (λ): Distance between consecutive similar points
- Frequency (f): Number of waves passing a point per second
- Time period (T): Time to complete one cycle

During one time period (T), the wave travels a distance equal to one wavelength (λ).

- v = velocity of the wave (m/s)
- λ = wavelength (m)
- f = frequency (Hz)

**Examples:**

- Light bending when entering water from air
- Apparent displacement of objects underwater
- Formation of rainbow
- Design of lenses and prisms

**Special cases:**

- When light travels from less dense to more dense medium (n₁ < n₂), it bends toward the normal (θ₁ > θ₂)
- When light travels from more dense to less dense medium (n₁ > n₂), it bends away from the normal (θ₁ < θ₂)
- When angle of incidence equals 0° (normal incidence), no refraction occurs

**Mnemonic:** "SINS - Sine of incidence over sine of refraction equals N₁ over N₂"

## Question 5(c)(2) [0 marks]

**Explain the Acceptance angle.**

**Answer**:

**Acceptance angle** is the maximum angle at which light can enter an optical fiber and still experience total internal reflection.

**Formula:** θₐ = sin⁻¹(NA)

Where:

- θₐ = Acceptance angle
- NA = Numerical aperture

**Numerical Aperture (NA):** NA = √(n₁² - n₂²)

Where:

- n₁ = Refractive index of the core
- n₂ = Refractive index of the cladding

**Significance:**

- Related to the fiber's information-carrying capacity
- Critical for coupling efficiency with light sources

**Mnemonic:** "CAP - Core and cladding indices Affect the acceptance angle which determines the Path light can take"

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Write a short note on total internal reflection of light.**

**Answer**:

**Total Internal Reflection (TIR)** is an optical phenomenon that occurs when light traveling in a denser medium hits the boundary with a less dense medium at an angle greater than the critical angle.

**Conditions required for TIR:**

- Light must travel from a denser medium to a less dense medium (n₁ > n₂)
- The angle of incidence must exceed the critical angle (θᵢ > θc)

**Critical angle formula:** θc = sin⁻¹(n₂/n₁)

## Question 5(c)(1) OR [3 marks]

**If the speed of light in water is 2.25×10⁸ m/s and the speed of light in air is 3×10⁸ m/s, find the refractive index of water.**

**Answer**:

**Given:**

- Speed of light in water (vw) = 2.25×10⁸ m/s
- Speed of light in air (va) = 3×10⁸ m/s

**To find:** Refractive index of water (nw)

**Formula:** n = c/v

**For calculation of refractive index of water relative to air:**
nw = va/vw

**Calculation:**
nw = 3×10⁸ m/s ÷ 2.25×10⁸ m/s
nw = 3 ÷ 2.25
nw = 1.33

Therefore, the refractive index of water is 1.33.

**Mnemonic:** "SVN - Speed of light in Vacuum divided by Speed in medium gives refractive iNdex"

        Core     Cladding
```

**Characteristics:**

- Abrupt change in refractive index at core-cladding boundary
- Available in both single-mode and multi-mode configurations
- Simpler construction than graded-index fiber
- More modal dispersion in multi-mode configuration

**Types:**

- **Single-mode step index fiber**:
  - Very small core diameter (8-10 μm)
  - Only allows one mode of light propagation
  - Low signal distortion
  - Used for long-distance communication
  
- **Multi-mode step index fiber**:

  - Higher modal dispersion
  - Suitable for shorter distances

**Advantages:**

- Simpler and cheaper manufacturing

- Less sensitive to bending losses than single-mode fibers

**Limitations:**

- Higher modal dispersion in multi-mode configuration
