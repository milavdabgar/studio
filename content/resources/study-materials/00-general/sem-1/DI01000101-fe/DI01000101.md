## Suggested Project List

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. **Demonstration Kit**: Prepare demonstration kit for various electrical laws that has been part of the course.
2. **Components Chart**: Prepare a chart for commonly used resistors, inductors and capacitors used in different domestic appliances (name of appliances with type and ratings)
3. **LED Tube Light**: Build and test the LED lamp circuit for its proper working.
4. **Power Factor Improvement**: Visit a nearby sub-station and observe the use of power capacitors for power factor improvement and prepare a report.

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

1. Prepare specification of resistor/inductor/capacitor
2. Calculate total installed electrical load of any premises
