Suggested Project List:
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar
micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Demonstration kit: Prepare demonstration kit for various electrical laws that has been part of the
course.
- Components: Prepare a chart for commonly used resistors, inductors and capacitors used in different
domestic appliances (name of appliances with type and ratings)
- LED tube light: Build and test the LED lamp circuit for its proper working.
- Power Factor Improvement: Visit a nearby sub-station and observe the use of power capacitors for
power factor improvement and prepare a report.
Suggested Activities for Students:
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested studentrelated co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this
course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for
each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful
for their placement interviews: a) Prepare specification of resistor/inductor/capacitor.
- Calculate total installed electrical load of any premises
