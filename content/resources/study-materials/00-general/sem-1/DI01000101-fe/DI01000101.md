## GUJARAT TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY

## Program Name: Diploma in Engineering

Level: Diploma

Branch: Electronics &amp; Communication Engineering / Power Electronics Course / Subject Code: DI01000101

Course / Subject Name: Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering

## Suggested Project List:

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a)  Demonstration kit: Prepare demonstration kit for various electrical laws that has been part of the course.
- b) Components: Prepare a chart for commonly used resistors, inductors and capacitors used in different domestic appliances (name of appliances with type and ratings)
- c) LED tube light: Build and test the LED lamp circuit for its proper working.
- d) Power Factor Improvement: Visit a nearby sub-station and observe the use of power capacitors for power factor improvement and prepare a report.

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated  cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews: a) Prepare specification of resistor/inductor/capacitor.

- b) Calculate total installed electrical load of any premises
