- HEORY OF COMMUNICATION

What are communication skills?

Definition:

Communication skills are the abilities you use when giving and receiving different kinds of information.
Some examples include communicating new ideas, feelings or even an update on your project.
Communication skills involve listening, speaking, observing and empathising. It is also helpful to understand
the differences in how to communicate through face-to-face interactions, phone conversations and digital
communications like email and social media.

A deep understanding of the process of communication and communication skills is essential. It is vital to the
success of any individual in any business. Here we shall see some of the many types of communication.

Communication styles change from person to person. During the process of communication, a person may
invoke several channels or modes or methods to convey a message. But, the process of communication doesn’t
only depend on the source producing or relaying information.

It also equally depends on the communication method and the manner in which the receiver understands the
message. Let us first understand Basic Model Of Communication

Basic Communication Model :

The sender-message-channel-receiver (SMCR) model of communication is an expansion of the Shannon-
Weaver model of communication. David Berlo created this model.

According to the Shannon-Weaver model, communication includes the following concepts: sender, encoder,
channel, decoder, receiver and feedback. Furthermore, there is also concept of "noise", which affects the
communication process going through the channel and makes the message more difficult to understand by the
receiver. Each of those concepts are defined as follows:
Sender: the originator of message.

Encoder: the transmitter which converts the message into signals (the way message is changed into signals, for
example sound waves).

Channel: the signal carrier or medium

Decoder: the reception place of the signal which converts signals into message. Decoding is done by the
receiver when he gets the message.

Receiver: the recipient of the message from the sender. He usually gives feedback to the sender in order to
make sure that the message was properly received.

Noise the message, transferred through a channel, can be interrupted by external noise (for instance,
conversation may be interrupted by thunder or crowd noise).
Feedback: The receiver can get an inaccurate message. This is why feedback from the receiver is important in
case the message is not properly received. Furthermore, the noise can also affect the decoding of the message by
the receiver.

Communication begins at a given point. The first step is the generation of information. The second step is to put
this information or data into a medium for transmission towards the intended audience.

During this process, the initiator of the communication must pay extra attention to the nature of the information.
The communication skills will determine the effectiveness of their communication.

Types:

On the basis of the communication channels, types of communications are:

A. Verbal
B. Non-Verbal
C. Visual

This involves the use of language and words for the purpose of passing on the intended message. In general
terms, Verbal Communication means communication in the form of spoken words only. But, in the context of
types of communication, verbal communication can be in the spoken or the written form. Thus, the verbal form
may be oral or written as discussed below.

- Written Communication: This kind of communication involves any kind of exchange of information in
the written form. For example, e-mails, texts, letters, reports, SMS, posts on social media platforms,
documents, handbooks, posters, flyers, etc.
- Oral Communication: This is the communication which employs the spoken word, either direct or
indirect as a communication channel. This verbal communication could be made on a channel that passes
information            in          only            one            form            i.e.          sound.
You could converse either face to face, or over the phone, or via voice notes or chat rooms, etc. It all
comes under the oral communication. This form of communication is an effective form.

Non-Verbal Communication

In this type of communication, messages are relayed without the transmission of words. The messages here are
wordless messages. This form of communication mainly assists verbal communication. It supplements it with
gestures, body language, symbols, and expressions.

Through these, one may communicate one’s mood, or opinion or even show a reaction to the messages that are
relaying. One’s non-verbal actions often set the tone for the dialogue. You can control and guide the
communication if you control and guide the non-verbal communication. Some of the modes of non-verbal
communication are:

Physical Non-verbal Communication

This is the sum total of the physically observable. For instance, hand gestures, body language, facial
expressions, the tone of one’s voice, posture, stance, touch, gaze, and others. Several researchers have revealed
that physical nonverbal communication constitutes about 55% of our daily communications.

These are subtle signals that are picked up as part of our biological wiring. For example, if you rest your head
on your palms, it will mean that you are very disappointed or angry. Similarly, other subtle hints will convey
your reaction to the presenter or your audience’s reaction to you.

Paralanguage

This is the art of reading between the lines. The main kind of such communication is done with the tone of
one’s voice. This kind of communication amounts to almost 38% of all the communication that we do every
day. Along with the tone of voice, the style of speaking, voice quality, stress, emotions, or intonation serves the
purpose of communication. And, these aspects are not verbal.

Visual:

Visual communication is the transmission of information and ideas using symbols and imagery. It is one of
three main types of communication, along with verbal communication (speaking) and non-verbal
communication (tone, body language, etc.). Visual communication is believed to be the type that people rely
on most, and it includes signs, graphic designs, films, typography, and countless other examples. Visual
communication can be represented in the form of a graph, a map, a chart, a Vann diagram, a pie chart, a
model, a table, or even multimedia like gifs, videos, and images.

Barrier To Communication:

There are many reasons why interpersonal communications may fail. In many communications, the message
(what is said) may not be received exactly the way the sender intended. It is, therefore, important that the
communicator seeks feedback to check that their message is clearly understood.

The skills of Active Listening, Clarification and Reflection may help but the skilled communicator also needs to
be aware of the barriers to effective communication and how to avoid or overcome them.

There are many barriers to communication and these may occur at any stage in the communication
process. Barriers may lead to your message becoming distorted and you therefore risk wasting both time and/or
money by causing confusion and misunderstanding.
Effective communication involves overcoming these barriers and conveying a clear and concise
message. Common Barriers to Effective Communication:

- The use of jargon. Over-complicated, unfamiliar and/or technical terms.

- Emotional barriers and taboos. Some people may find it difficult to express their emotions and some
topics may be completely 'off-limits' or taboo. Taboo or difficult topics may include, but are not limited

to, politics, religion, disabilities (mental and physical), racism and any opinion that may be seen as
unpopular.
- Lack of attention, interest, distractions, or irrelevance to the receiver. Differences in perception and
viewpoint.
- Physical disabilities such as hearing problems or speech difficulties.
- Physical barriers to non-verbal communication. Not being able to see the non-verbal cues, gestures,
posture and general body language can make communication less effective. Phone calls, text messages
and other communication methods that rely on technology are often less effective than face-to-face
- Language differences and the difficulty in understanding unfamiliar accents.
- Expectations and prejudices which may lead to false assumptions or stereotyping. People often hear
what they expect to hear rather than what is actually said and jump to incorrect conclusions.
- Cultural differences. The norms of social interaction vary greatly in different cultures, as do the way in
which emotions are expressed. For example, the concept of personal space varies between cultures and
between different social settings.
- A skilled communicator must be aware of these barriers and try to reduce their impact by continually
checking understanding and by offering appropriate feedback.

- NIT 2. TENSES
In grammar, tense is a category that expresses time reference with reference to the moment of speaking.
Tenses are usually manifested by the use of specific forms of verbs, particularly in their conjugation
patterns. It is very essential to have knowledge of tenses for correct use of a language to establish effective
communication.
There are three types of Tenses- Present, Past and Future.
Example:
- We watch movies every weekend. - Present Tense
- He wrote an application for that job yesterday. - Past Tense
- You will complete the project by next month. – Future Tense

Present Tense – The verb in present tense refers to the present time.
Past Tense- The verb in past tense refers to the past time.
Future Tense- The verb in future tense refers to the future time.
The tense of a verb shows not only time of action but also the state of action referred to. Each of these
Tenses has four sub tenses-
1) Simple,
2) Continuous,
3) Perfect and
4) Perfect Continuous Tense.

Simple or Indefinite Tense:
Here the verb specifies the simple action, without anything being said about the completeness or
incompleteness of the action.
Sub Tense      Person                 Singular                               Plural
Present        First person           I speak                                We speak
Second person          You speak                              You speak
Third person           He / She / It speaks                   They speak
Past           First person           I Spoke                                We spoke

- NIT 4. SUBJECT VERB AGREEMENT
Subject – Verb Agreement means the harmony between the subject of the sentence and the verb. The verb
always follows the subject of the sentence.
1. A finite verb must agree its subject in person and number.
Examples:
- I am reading a book.
- He is playing.
- The child is playing.
- The children are watching cartoons.

2. The Error of Proximity:
In cases where subject and verb are separated by a long phrase or a clause, the verb agrees with the
real subject and not the noun or pronoun placed next to it.
Examples:
- The apples in the basket are fresh.
- The strong bond of affection between the two cousins was obvious.
- The joys one experiences in one’s childhood are beyond description.
3. The Introductory ‘There’:
In a sentence beginning with there, the verb agrees with the real subject that follows there.

(a) Subject consists of two or more nouns or pronouns joined by and- PLURAL Verb.

(c) The nouns convey the same meaning, placed together only for emphasis-Singular verb
- The honour and the glory of my country is uppermost in my mind.
- The power and influence Gandhiji exerted over the Indian masses was really great.

5. Subject consists of two nouns or pronouns joined with as well as, together with, along with, in
addition to: verb agrees with the first subject
Examples:

- Mr. Das as well as his friends has escaped unhurt.
- You as well as I are responsible for our losses.
- The captain with othe team members was given a hearty welcome.

6.Two subjects joined with not only, but also: Verb agrees with the latter subject

Examples:
- Either you or Gaurav is responsible for the mistake.
- Neither Gaurav nor you are responsible for the mistake.

8. One subject singular and the other plural
The pattern is: Either /Neither+ Singular sub +or/nor + Plural sub. Plural verb
Examples:

- NIT 5 Basic Sentence Patterns of English

Sentence: A sentence is a textual unit consisting of one or more words that are grammatically linked.
Here we will study basic four patterns of English. For better understanding of the same, We need to
understand the following terms.
Subject: A subject is a part of a sentence that contains the person or thing performing the action (or verb) in
a sentence. Traditionally the subject is the word or phrase which controls the verb in the clause.
- The peon rings the bell.
Verb: Verbs are words that express action or state of being. You have studied about them in parts of speech
and tenses. They are action words in the sentence.
- He runs fast.

Object: An object is a noun, a noun phrase, or a pronoun that is affected by the action of a verb.

- Ram is reading a newspaper.

Adverbial: Adverbials are words that we use to give more information about a verb. They can be one word
(angrily, here) or phrases (at home, in a few hours) and often say how, where, when or how often something
happens or is done, though they can also have other uses..

- He speaks fluently.
- Lata ate breakfast yesterday morning.

Complement: Complement is the term used for a word or words that are needed to complete the meaning
of an expression.
- Algebra is difficult.

The following are basic four patterns to make a meaningful sentence.

1. S + V : Subject + Verb

- He/ laughed.
- Dogs/ bark.
- We /enjoyed.

2. S+V+O: Subject + Verb+ Object
- We / received / the parcel.
- Many students / witnessed / the play.
- The police / arrested / the thief

3. S+V+A: Subject + Verb+ Adverbial
- The train / arrived / late
- It / rained / last night

4. S+V+C: Subject + Verb+ Complement

- They / are / players.

                                            Unit 1
                                          The Leopard
                                                                    Ruskin Bond

I first saw the leopard when I was crossing the small stream at the bottom of the hill.
The ravine was so deep that for most of the day it remained in shadow. This encouraged many birds and
animals to emerge from cover during daylight hours. Few people ever passed that way: only milkmen
and charcoal-burners from the surrounding villages.
As a result, the ravine had become a little haven of wildlife, one of the few natural sanctuaries left near
Mussoorie, a hill- station in northern India.
Below my cottage was a forest of oak and maple and Himalayan rhododendron. A narrow path twisted
its way down through the trees, over an open ridge where red sorrel grew wild, and then steeply down
through a tangle of wild raspberries, creeping vines and slender bamboo.
At the bottom of the hill the path led on to a grassy verge, surrounded by wild dog roses. (It is
surprising how closely the flora of the lower Himalayas, between 5,000 to 8,000 feet, resembles
that of the English countryside.)
The stream ran close by the verge, tumbling over smooth pebbles, over rocks worn yellow with
age, on its way to the plains and to the little Song River and finally to the sacred Ganges.
When I first discovered the stream it was early April and the wild roses were flowering—small white
blossoms lying in clusters.
     I walked down to the stream almost every day, after two or three hours of writing.
```

I had lived in cities too long, and had returned to the hills to renew myself, both physically and
mentally. Once you have lived with mountains for any length of time, you belong to them, and must
return again and again.
Nearly every morning, and sometimes during the day, I heard the cry of the barking deer. And in the
evening, walking through the forest, I disturbed parties of pheasant. The birds went gliding down the
ravine on open, motionless wings. I saw pine martens and a handsome red fox, and I recognized the
footprints of a bear.
As I had not come to take anything from the forest, the birds and animals soon grew accustomed to my
presence; or possibly they recognized my footsteps. Aftersome time, my approach did not disturb them.
The langurs in the oak and rhododendron trees, who would at first go leaping through the branches at
my approach, now watched me with some curiosity as theymunched the tender green shoots of the oak.
The young ones scuffled and wrestled like boys, while their parents groomed each other’s coats,
stretching themselves out on the sunlit hillside. But one evening, as I passed, I heard them chattering
in the trees, and I knew I was not the cause of their excitement.
As I crossed the stream and began climbing the hill, the grunting and chattering increased, as though the
langurs were trying to warn me of some hidden danger. A shower of pebbles came rattling down the
steep hillside, and I looked up to see a sinewy, orange-gold leopard poised on a rock about twenty feet
above me.
It was not looking towards me, but had its head thrust attentively forward, in the direction of the
ravine. Yet it must have sensed my presence, because it slowly turned its head and looked down at
It seemed a little puzzled at my presence there; and when, to give myself courage, I clapped my hands

sharply, the leopard sprang away into the thickets, making absolutely no sound as it melted into the
shadows.
I had disturbed the animal in its quest for food. But a little after I heard the quickening cry of a barking
deer as it fled through the forest. The hunt was still on.
The leopard, like other members of the cat family, is nearing extinction in India, and I was surprised
to find one so close to Mussoorie. Probably the deforestation that had been taking place in the
surrounding hills had driven the deer into this green valley; and the leopard, naturally, had followed.
It was some weeks before I saw the leopard again, although I was often made aware of its presence. A
dry, rasping cough sometimes gave it away. At times I feltalmost certain that I was being followed.
Once, when I was late getting home, and the brief twilight gave way to a dark, moonless night, I was
startled by a family of porcupines running about in a clearing. I looked around nervously, and saw two
bright eyes staring at me from a thicket. I stood still, my heart banging away against my ribs. Then the
eyes danced away, and Irealized that they were only fireflies.
In May and June, when the hills were brown and dry, it was always cool and green near the stream,
where ferns and maidenhair and long grasses continued to thrive.
Downstream I found a small pool where I could bathe, and a cave with water dripping from the roof,
the water spangled gold and silver in the shafts of sunlightthat pushed through the slits in the cave roof.
- He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.’ Perhaps David
had discovered a similar paradise when he wrote those words; perhaps I, too, would write good
words. The hill-station’s summer visitors had not discovered this haven of wild and green things. I was
beginning to feel thatthe place belonged to me, that dominion was mine.
The stream had at least one other regular visitor, a spotted forktail, and though it did not fly away at my
approach it became restless if I stayed too long, and then it would move from boulder to boulder
uttering a long complaining cry.
I spent an afternoon trying to discover the bird’s nest, which I was certain contained young ones,
because I had seen the forktail carrying grubs in her bill. The problem was that when the bird flew
upstream I had difficulty in following her rapidly enough as the rocks were sharp and slippery.
Eventually I decorated myself with bracken fronds and, after slowly making my way upstream, hid
myself in the hollow stump of a tree at a spot where the forktail often disappeared. I had no intention
of robbing the bird: I was simply curious to seeits home.
By crouching down, I was able to command a view of a small stretch of the stream and the sides of
the ravine; but I had done little to deceive the forktail, who continued to object strongly to my
presence so near her home.
I summoned up my reserves of patience and sat perfectly still for about ten minutes. The forktail
quietened down. Out of sight, out of mind. But where had she gone? Probably into the walls of the
ravine where I felt sure, she was guarding hernest.
I decided to take her by surprise, and stood up suddenly, in time to see not the forktail on her
doorstep, but the leopard bounding away with a grunt of surprise! Two urgent springs, and it had
crossed the stream and plunged into the forest.
I was as astonished as the leopard, and forgot all about the forktail and her nest. Had the leopard
been following me again? I decided against this possibility. Only man-eaters follow humans, and, as
far as I knew, there had never been a man-eaterin the vicinity of Mussoorie.
During the monsoon the stream became a rushing torrent, bushes and small trees were swept away,
and the friendly murmur of the water became a threatening boom. I did not visit the place too often, as
there were leeches in the long grass.
One day I found the remains of a barking deer which had only been partly eaten. I wondered why the

leopard had not hidden the rest of his meal, and decided that it must have been disturbed while eating.
Then, climbing the hill, I met a party of hunters resting beneath the oaks. They asked me if I had seen a
leopard. I said I had not. They said they knew there was a leopard in the forest.
Leopard skins, they told me, were selling in Delhi at over 1,000 rupees each. Of course there was a ban
on the export of skins, but they gave me to understand that there were ways and means. . . . I thanked
them for their information and walked on,feeling uneasy and disturbed.
The hunters had seen the carcass of the deer, and they had seen the leopard’s pug- marks, and they kept
coming to the forest. Almost every evening I heard their guns banging away; for they were ready to
fire at almost anything.
- There’s a leopard about,’ they always told me. ‘You should carry a gun.’‘I don’t have one,’ I said.
There were fewer birds to be seen, and even the langurs had moved on. The red fox did not show
itself; and the pine martens, who had become quite bold, now dashed into hiding, at my approach. The
smell of one human is like the smell of anyother.
And then the rains were over and it was October; I could lie in the sun, on sweet- smelling grass, and
gaze up through a pattern of oak leaves into a blinding blue heaven. And I would praise God for leaves
and grass and the smell of things, the smell of mint and bruised clover, and the touch of things—the
touch of grass and airand sky, the touch of the sky’s blueness.
I thought no more of the men. My attitude towards them was similar to that of the denizens of the forest.
These were men, unpredictable, and to be avoided if possible.
On the other side of the ravine rose Pari Tibba, Hill of the Fairies: a bleak, scrub- covered hill where
no one lived.
It was said that in the previous century Englishmen had tried building their houses on the hill, but the
area had always attracted lightning, due to either the hill’s location or due to its mineral deposits; after
several houses had been struck by lightning, the settlers had moved on to the next hill, where the town
now stands.
To the hillmen it is Pari Tibba, haunted by the spirits of a pair of ill-fated loverswho perished there in a
storm; to others it is known as Burnt Hill, because of its scarred and stunted trees.
One day, after crossing the stream, I climbed Pari Tibba—a stiff undertaking, because there was no
path to the top and I had to scramble up a precipitous rock-face with the help of rocks and roots that
were apt to come loose in my groping hand.
But at the top was a plateau with a few pine trees, their upper branches catching the wind and
humming softly. There I found the ruins of what must have been the houses of the first settlers—just a
few piles of rubble, now overgrown with weeds,sorrel, dandelions and nettles.
As I walked through the roofless ruins, I was struck by the silence that surrounded me, the absence of
birds and animals, the sense of complete desolation.
The silence was so absolute that it seemed to be ringing in my ears. But there was something else of
which I was becoming increasingly aware: the strong feline odour of one of the cat family.
I paused and looked about. I was alone. There was no movement of dry leaf or loose stone. The ruins
were for the most part open to the sky. Their rotting rafters had collapsed, jamming together to form
a low passage like the entrance to a mine;and this dark cavern seemed to lead down into the ground.
The smell was stronger when I approached this spot, so I stopped again and waited there, wondering
if I had discovered the lair of the leopard, wondering if the animal was now at rest after a night’s
hunt.
Perhaps he was crouching there in the dark, watching me, recognizing me, knowing me as the man
who walked alone in the forest without a weapon.
I like to think that he was there, that he knew me, and that he acknowledged my visit in the

friendliest way: by ignoring me altogether.
Perhaps I had made him confident—too confident, too careless, too trusting of thehuman in his midst.
I did not venture any further; I was not out of my mind. I did not seek physical contact, or even another
glimpse of that beautiful sinewy body, springing from rock to rock. It was his trust I wanted, and I
think he gave it to me.
But did the leopard, trusting one man, make the mistake of bestowing his trust on others? Did I, by
casting out all fear—my own fear, and the leopard’s protective fear —leave him defenseless?
Because next day, coming up the path from the stream, shouting and beating drums, were the hunters.
They had a long bamboo pole across their shoulders; and slung from the pole, feet up, head down,
was the lifeless body of the leopard, shot in the neck and in the head.
- We told you there was a leopard!’ they shouted, in great good humour. ‘Isn’t he afine specimen?’
- Yes,’ I said. ‘He was a beautiful leopard.’
I walked home through the silent forest. It was very silent, almost as though the birds and animals knew
that their trust had been violated.
I remembered the lines of a poem by D. H. Lawrence; and, as I climbed the steep and lonely path to
my home, the words beat out their rhythm in my mind: ‘There was room in the world for a mountain
lion and me.’

- NIT 2 After Twenty Years
O'Henry
The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The impressiveness was habitual and not for show,
for spectators were few. The time was barely 10 o'clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them
had well nigh depeopled the streets.

Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements, turning now and then to cast his
watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and slight swagger, made a fine
picture of a guardian of the peace. The vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights
of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had
long since been closed.

When about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his walk. In the doorway of a darkened
hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man
spoke up quickly.

- It's all right, officer," he said, reassuringly. "I'm just waiting for a friend. It's an appointment made twenty years ago.
Sounds a little funny to you, doesn't it? Well, I'll explain if you'd like to make certain it's all straight. About that long
ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands--'Big Joe' Brady's restaurant."

- Until five years ago," said the policeman. "It was torn down then."

The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes,
and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set.

- Twenty years ago to-night," said the man, "I dined here at 'Big Joe' Brady's with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and
the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together. I was eighteen
and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn't have dragged
Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well, we agreed that night that we would meet
here again exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from what
distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out
and our fortunes made, whatever they were going to be."

- It sounds pretty interesting," said the policeman. "Rather a long time between meets, though, it seems to me.
Haven't you heard from your friend since you left?"
- Well, yes, for a time we corresponded," said the other. "But after a year or two we lost track of each other. You see,
the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me
here if he's alive, for he always was the truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He'll never forget. I came a thousand
miles to stand in this door to-night, and it's worth it if my old partner turns up."

The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with small diamonds.

- Three minutes to ten," he announced. "It was exactly ten o'clock when we parted here at the restaurant door."

- Did pretty well out West, didn't you?" asked the policeman.

- You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder, though, good fellow as he was. I've had to
compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York. It takes the West
to put a razor-edge on him."

The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.
- I'll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to call time on him sharp?"

- I should say not!" said the other. "I'll give him half an hour at least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he'll be here by that
time. So long, officer."

- Good-night, sir," said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he went.

There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few
foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed
hands. And in the door of the hardware store the man who had come a thousand miles to fill an appointment,
uncertain almost to absurdity, with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and waited.

About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried
across from the opposite side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.

- Is that you, Bob?" he asked, doubtfully.

- Is that you, Jimmy Wells?" cried the man in the door.

- Bless my heart!" exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other's hands with his own. "It's Bob, sure as fate. I
was certain I'd find you here if you were still in existence. Well, well, well--twenty years is a long time. The old gone,
Bob; I wish it had lasted, so we could have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you, old man?"

- Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You've changed lots, Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall by
two or three inches."

- Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty." "Doing

well in New York, Jimmy?"

- Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come on, Bob; we'll go around to a place I know of,
and have a good long talk about old times."

The two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West, his egotism enlarged by success, was
beginning to outline the history of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest.

At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When they came into this glare each of them turned
simultaneously to gaze upon the other's face.

The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.

- You're not Jimmy Wells," he snapped. "Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change a man's nose

from a Roman to a pug."

- It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one," said the tall man. "You've been under arrest for ten minutes,
- Silky' Bob. Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you.
Going quietly, are you? That's sensible. Now, before we go on to the station here's a note I was asked to hand you.
You may read it here at the window. It's from Patrolman Wells."

The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him. His hand was steady when he began to read,
but it trembled a little by the time he had finished. The note was rather short.

- Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the
face of the man wanted in Chicago. Somehow I couldn't do it myself, so I went around and got a plain
clothes man to do the job.”

- NIT 3 Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening
Robert Frost

Whose woods these are I think I know.
His house is in the village though;
He will not see me stopping here
To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer
To stop without a farmhouse near
Between the woods and frozen lake
The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake
To ask if there is some mistake.
The only other sound’s the sweep
Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep,
But I have promises to keep,
And miles to go before I sleep,

Email Writing
The email writing format is the same for each of the categories, though the choice of words and language differ
depending upon the type of email. One can use friendly and casual language in informal emails. The language
used in formal emails should be professional, clear, and formal.

Email Format
Let us look at the important steps to follow when writing a formal email.

1. Subject line
Grab attention with the subject line. The first part of an email which your recipient sees is the subject of the
email. If you do not put it well, you risk having your email not opened until later or at all. Here are some
things to keep in mind:

- Make the subject line specific, simple, and to the point. For example, instead of 'The internship
report you asked for', write, 'Internship Report, {date/week/month}'.
- The subject line should be short. Ideally, your subject line should stand around six words.
- Keep the most important and informative words in the beginning of the subject line.
- Use markers like Fwd, Reply, Urgent, or Notice to further narrow down the subject. It informs your
reader about the nature of your email.

Some of the examples of good subject lines in formal emails can be:

- Marketing Data for July 2018

- Marketing Budget, October 2018
- List of New Freelancers
- Job Application for the Post of XYZ
- Leave Application
- Query Regarding the Missing Information in the Document
- Contract Agreement - XYZ Assignment

2. Salutation
Each email is directed towards someone. Start your formal email with addressing the recipient in a manner
fitting the relationship you have with them.

For people you are unfamiliar with or do not know the names of, use 'To Whom It May Concern' or 'Dear
sir/madam'.
For senior officials, stick to their designation or follow it with their name, for example, 'To the Manager',
- Dear Dr. Ghosh', or 'Dear Ms. Kapoor'.
Among colleagues, it may be appropriate to simply precede the name with a 'Hi'.
Do not skip the salutation and always be respectful. Never use nicknames or just surnames or first names in
a formal email.

3. Body of the email
The body text is the main part of your email. It is important to follow a certain pattern when writing the
body of your email.

- The opening paragraph should set the tone and reason for your email. Introduce yourself if you
are a stranger to the person you are writing to, and jot down why you are writing to them.
- For example, you can begin with 'My name is Abc, and this email is with reference to Xyz.' or 'This is
with reference to the marketing budget as discussed in the meeting.'
- Elaborate on your concern, question, or response as comprehensively as possible. Write in a way
that is easy to understand, but at the same time, do not lose your point in providing unnecessary
information. Say only what is required.
- The closing of the email should also support the nature of your email. If you are asking a question,
close with something like 'Hope to have an answer from you soon', or 'Looking forward to hearing
from you soon', and if you are addressing a question, end with 'Hope I have sufficiently answered
your query/doubts.'
- Signature
- These are the last words of your email, capable of forming a lasting impression on your reader.

- Sign off with a simple word or phrase, which conveys respect. Safe choices are 'Best regards',
- Warmly', 'Sincerely', 'Kind regards', or simply 'Thanks'.
- If you are writing to someone for the first time or someone who is not an immediate colleague or
senior, use your full name.

- Furnish your name with contact information. Your phone number and/or work address are
enough.
- If you are writing on behalf of or as an employee of an institution, make sure to mention it along
with adequate contact details
- To make your signature even more effective, you may also choose or design an attractive (but not
flashy) template.

Formal Email Samples
Formal emails are sent in a whole variety of situations. While they use the same rules, they may have to be
modified according to their purpose.

Now that you are familiar with the format of a formal email, let us have a look at few email samples.

Email sample 1: A request
Subject: Extension on Report Deadline

Dear Mr./Ms. {Recipient’s sir name},

I am writing this to request you for an extension on the XYZ project report which is due

Business Letters

A business letter is a letter from one company to another, or between such organizations and their
customers, clients, or other external parties. The overall style of letter depends on the relationship between
the parties concerned. Business letters can have many types of content, for example to request direct
information or action from another party, to order supplies from a supplier, to point out a mistake by the
letter's recipient, to reply directly to a request, to apologize for a wrong, or to convey goodwill. A business
letter is useful because it produces a permanent written record, and may be taken more seriously by the
recipient than other forms of communication.
Qualities of a Good Letter:
The 7 Cs of business communication which make it are:

1.   Clarity
2.   Correctness
3.   Conciseness
4.   Courtesy
5.   Concreteness
6.   Consideration
7.   Completeness

- 1: Clarity
Practicing clarity in your communication ensures that the message is received accurately. You should know
what you wish to say and how to say it. Use language that can be easily understood, and resist the temptation
to include unnecessary information.
Example:
Instead of saying, “We have considered the consequences of the existing policy on the hiring strategies we
employ with our human resources department and updated them accordingly,” say, “We have updated our
hiring policy.”

- 2: Correctness
You must communicate with correctness – correct grammar, language, data, etc. In written communication,
you should proofread before sending.
Example:
- You may enter the building during opening hours but must show relevant I.D.”
Immediately, the recipient of this information has two questions:

    “What are the opening hours, and what ID is considered relevant?

Correctness in this communication is conveyed by saying, “You may enter the building during the opening
hours of 9am to 5pm daily, but must show your employee identity card.”

- 3: Conciseness
Never use more words than is necessary. Brevity is more easily understood, though you must avoid
discourtesy. Concise messages save you and the recipient time, too. To be concise, follow these rules:

- Eliminate unnecessary words

- Use action verbs
- Remove repetition

Example:
- As a matter of fact, during the month of June, all employees must ensure that they wear appropriate
clothing to ensure they stay cool while the air-conditioning is being repaired.”
Becomes:
- Indeed, during June, employees must wear appropriate clothing to stay cool while the air-conditioning is

- 4: Courtesy
Employ courtesy when communicating. This shows you respect the recipient and helps to build goodwill.
You must ensure that you are sincere, thoughtful, and do not use discriminatory language.
Example:
- I don’t appreciate how your team ignores requests for collaboration from my team. The work we do is
equally as important as your work. Could you make certain that your team collaborates more readily from
now on?”
Such a message is unlikely to encourage a negative response. Instead, a more effective approach would be:
- I understand that your team is extremely busy and receives many requests to collaborate on project work.
However, my team is working a highly urgent project with enormous mutual benefits. I would greatly
appreciate if you could ask your team to collaborate more effectively with mine to move this project forward
faster. If there is any help that we can provide to make this happen, please let me know.”

- 5: Concreteness
Concrete communication is specific, clear, and meaningful. It avoids vagueness, uses available facts and
figures to add authenticity, and builds around an active voice.
Example:
An example would be poor communication of underperformance during a one-to-one. You might say, “Your
sales numbers are on the low side. They need to be improved to at least the team’s average.”
Give your employee concrete direction with evidence and an active voice:
- Your sales conversion rate is below 50%. You must improve this to the team average of 65% or higher.”

- 6: Consideration
Be considerate with your messaging by putting yourself in the position of the recipient. Focus on
communicating to ‘you’, considering needs and issues experienced by the recipient.
Example:
Imagine that you are unable to pay a promised bonus. How do you communicate this?
- We are unable to pay bonuses now. The business is awaiting payment from a major client. Once this
payment is received, we can consider paying contractual bonuses as soon as is practicable.”
This could be better conveyed as follows:
- Unfortunately, we are not presently in the position to pay your bonus. However, as soon as our major client
has settled their account, we will pay any bonuses owed to you. We’re sorry about this delay, but are sure
you understand our need for positive cash flow and the long-term benefits this will deliver to you.”

- 7: Completeness
Your message should be complete, delivering all the facts needed for the recipient to make an informed
decision. Incomplete messages often receive poor responses.
To ensure your communication is complete, ask if it answers the what, when, why, who, where, and how.
Example:
- You haven’t completed the task that I set you,” is a message full of ambiguity. Instead, make sure you
include all relevant facts:
- The data analysis for client ABC that I asked for on March 5 should have been completed by today. Will
you have it finished this afternoon?”
Format:
A business letter must include:

1. Address

The address of the person receiving the correspondence includes a formal name, street address, city, state,
and pin code.

2. Date

The date is put for any business communication.

The date is a critical piece of information documenting when the correspondence was sent.

This is important for correspondence that may be kept for future reference.

3. Subject Line

This indicates the subject of the letter so the receiver gets the idea what is the letter about.

4. Salutation

The salutation is the formal way of addressing the person.

Common salutations are Dear or To Whom It May Concern.

5. Introduction

The first few sentences of a letter are introductory.

The introduction section introduces the subject of the letter.

It is a summary in a sentence or two that explains the goal of the letter.

For example, an introduction may be something like:

I am writing today to further explore a vendor relationship with XYZ Corporation.

6. Body of the Letter

The body of the letter is where the bulk of the information is shared.

The body of the letter explains in detail all aspects of what is being communicated.

This would include detail of the information being shared.

For instance, the body may be something like this:

We understand that XYZ Corporation can provide tools for 10% less than other competitors. And, that the focus on
service after the sale is amongst the best in the industry.

7. Closing

The closing of the letter summarizes what the letter was about and any next steps or action items.

This section gives the reader a heads up that the communication is coming to a close.

For instance, the closing may be something like this:

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss a vendor relationship and to explore if we can come to a
mutually beneficial relationship. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

8. Signature

The signature section has a complimentary closing.

Examples are Sincerely, Warmest Regards, Respectfully Yours, Very Truly Yours, or Cordially Yours.

Be sure to gauge the audience when selecting a complimentary closing.

After the complimentary closing, space is left for the signature that goes above the typed name and title of
the person sending the letter.
