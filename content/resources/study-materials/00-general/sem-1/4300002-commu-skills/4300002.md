Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions  to  assess  the  attainment  of  the  UOs.  The  actual  distribution  of  marks  at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- The experiments should be properly designed and implemented with an attempt to develop different types of skills leading to the achievement of the competency.
- Initiating a conversation with a new comer to your college.
- Assignments using Internet. (Online Listening/Speaking/Vocabulary based exercises and  uploading  their  score,  etc.  (Teacher  can  decide  how  to  use  various  online platforms for evaluation purpose.

- Self-learning Activities using mobile apps/internet
- Discuss current affairs in English with your friends.
- Read storybooks and learn new words and sentence structures.
- Write a brief report on current environmental issues.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

1. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
2. Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
3. Comprehension of passage and making presentation can given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
4. Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based  (group  of  3  to  5).  However, in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters ,  the  number  of students in the group should not exceed three .

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar  presentation  of  it  before  submission.

# SECTION 1: THEORY OF COMMUNICATION

## What are communication skills?

## Definition

Communication skills are  the  abilities  you  use  when  giving  and  receiving  different  kinds  of  information. Some  examples  include  communicating  new ideas, feelings or even an update on your project. Communication skills involve listening, speaking, observing and empathising. It is also helpful to understand the  differences  in  how  to  communicate  through  face-to-face  interactions,  phone  conversations  and  digital communications like email and social media.

A deep understanding of the process of communication and communication skills is essential. It is vital to the success of any individual in any business. Here we shall see some of the many types of communication.

Communication styles change from  person  to  person.  During  the  process  of  communication,  a  person  may invoke several channels or modes or methods to convey a message. But, the process of communication doesn't only depend on the source producing or relaying information.

It also equally depends on the communication method and the manner in which the receiver understands the message. Let us first understand Basic Model Of Communication

## Basic  Communication Model

T he sender-message-channel-receiver  (SMCR)  model  of  communication is  an  expansion  of  the ShannonWeaver model of communication. David Berlo created this model .

According to the Shannon-Weaver model, communication includes the following concepts: sender, encoder, channel,  decoder,  receiver  and feedback.  Furthermore,  there  is  also  concept  of  "noise",  which  affects  the communication process going through the channel and makes the message more difficult to understand by the receiver. Each of those concepts are defined as follows:

Sender : the originator of message.

Encode r: the transmitter which converts the message into signals (the way message is changed into signals, for example sound waves).

C hannel : the signal carrier or medium

Decode r: the reception place of the signal which converts signals into message. Decoding is done by the receiver when he gets the message.

Receiver: the recipient of the message from the sender. He usually gives feedback to the sender in order to make sure that the message was properly received.

Noise the message, transferred through a channel, can be interrupted by external noise (for instance, conversation may be interrupted by thunder or crowd noise).

Feedback: The receiver can get an inaccurate message. This is why feedback from the receiver is important in case the message is not properly received. Furthermore, the noise can also affect the decoding of the message by the receiver.

Communication begins at a given point. The first step is the generation of information. The second step is to put this information or data into a medium for transmission towards the intended audience.

During this process, the initiator of the communication must pay extra attention to the nature of the information. The communication skills will determine the effectiveness of their communication.

## Types

On the basis of the communication channels, types of communic ations are:

- A. Verbal
- B. Non-Verbal
- C. Visual

## Verbal

This involves the use of language and words for the purpose of passing on the intended message. In general terms, Verbal Communication means communication in the form of spoken words only. But, in the context of types of communication, verbal communication can be in the spoken or the written form. Thus, the verbal form may be oral or written as discussed below.

- Written Communication: This kind of communication involves the  written  form.  For  example,  e-mails,  texts,  letters,  reports,  SMS,  posts  on  social  media  platforms, documents, handbooks, posters, flyers, etc. any kind of exchange of information in
- Oral  Communication: This  is  the  communication indirect as a communication channel. This verbal communication could be made on a channel that passes information in only one form i.e. sound. You could converse either face to face, or over the phone, or via voice notes or chat rooms, etc. It all comes under the oral communication. This form of communication is an effective form. which  employs  the  spoken  word,  either  direct  or

## Non -Verbal Communication

In this type of communication, messages are relayed without the transmission of words. The messages here are wordless messages. This form of communication mainly assists ver gestures, body language, symbols, and expressions. bal communication. It supplements it with

Through these, one may communicate one's mood, or opinion or even show a reaction to the messages that are relaying.  One's  non-verbal  actions  often  set  the  tone  for  the  dialogue.  You  can  control  and  guide  the communication if  you  control  and  guide  the  non-verbal  communication.  Some  of  the  modes  of  non-verbal communication are:

## Physical Non-verbal Communication

This  is  the  sum  total  of  the  physically  observable.  For  instance,  hand  gestures,  body  language,  facial expressions, the tone of one's voice, posture, stance, touch, gaze, and others. Several researchers have revealed that physical nonverbal communication constitutes about 55% of our daily communications.

These are subtle signals that are picked up as part of our biological wiring. For example, if you rest your head on your palms, it will mean that you are very disappointed or angry. Similarly, other subtle hints will convey your reaction to the presenter or your audience's reaction to you.

## Paralanguage

This is the art of reading between the lines. The main kind of such communication is done with the tone of one's voice. This kind of communication amounts to almost 38% of all the communication that we do every day. Along with the tone of voice, the style of speaking, voice quality, stress, emotions, or intonation serves the purpose of communication. And, these aspects are not verbal.

## Visual

Visual communication is the transmission of  information and ideas using symbols and imagery.  It is  one  of three main types of communication, along with verbal communication (speaking) and non-verbal communication (tone, body language, etc.). Visual communication is believed to be the type that people rely on  most,  and  it  includes  signs,  graphic  designs,  films,  typography,  and  countless  other  examples.  Visual communication can be represented in the form of a graph, a map, a chart, a Vann  diagram,  a  pie chart,  a model, a table, or even multimedia like gifs, videos, and images.

## Barrier To Communication

There are many reasons why interpersonal communications may fail. In many communications, the message (what  is  said)  may  not  be  received  exactly  the  way  the  sender  intended.  It  is,  therefore,  important  that  the communicator seeks feedback to check that their message is clearly understood.

The skills of Active Listening, Clarification and Reflection may help but the skilled communicator also needs to be aware of the barriers to effective communication and how to avoid or overcome them.

There  are  many  barriers  to  communication  and  these  may  occur  at  any  stage  in  the  communication process. Barriers may lead to your message becoming distorted and you therefore risk wasting both time and/or money by causing confusion and misunderstanding.

Effective communication involves overcoming these barriers and conveying a clear and concise message. Common Barriers to Effective Communication:

- The use of jargon. Over-complicated, unfamiliar and/or technical terms.
- Emotional barriers and  taboos. Some people may find it  difficult  to  express  their  emotions  and  some topics may be completely 'off-limits' or taboo. Taboo or difficult topics may include, but are not limited

- to,  politics,  religion,  disabilities  (mental  and  physical),  racism  and  any  opinion  that  may  be  seen  as unpopular.
- Lack  of  attention,  interest,  distractions,  or  irrelevance  to  the  receiver.   Differences  in  perception  and viewpoint.
- Physical disabilities such as hearing problems or speech difficulties.
- Physical  barriers  to  non-verbal  communication. Not  being  able  to  see  the  non-verbal  cues,  gestures, posture and general body language can make communication less effective. Phone calls, text messages and  other  communication  methods  that  rely  on  technology  are  often  less  effective  than  face-to-face communication.
- Language differences and the difficulty in understanding unfamiliar accents.
- Expectations  and  prejudices  which may  lead  to  false  assumptions  or  stereotyping.   People  often  hear what they expect to hear rather than what is actually said and jump to incorrect conclusions.
- Cultural differences.  The norms of social interaction vary greatly in different cultures, as do the way in which emotions are expressed. For example, the concept of personal space varies between cultures and between different social settings.
- A skilled communicator must be aware of these barriers and try to reduce their impact by continually checking understanding and by offering appropriate feedback.

## UNIT 2. TENSES

In  grammar, tense is a category  that expresses time reference with reference to  the moment of speaking. Tenses  are  usually  manifested  by  the  use  of  specific  forms  of  verbs,  particularly  in  their  conjugation patterns. It is very essential to have knowledge of tenses for correct use of a language to establish effective communication.

There are three types of Tenses: Present, Past and Future.

## Example

- We watch movies every weekend. - Present Tense
- He wrote an application for that job yesterday. - Past Tense
- You will complete the project by next month. - Future Tense

Present Tense - The verb in present tense refers to the present time.

Past Tense - The verb in past tense refers to the past time.

Future Tense - The verb in future tense refers to the future time.

The tense of a verb shows not only time of action but also the state of action  referred to. Each of these Tenses has four sub tenses-

- 1) Simple,
- 2) Continuous,
- 3) Perfect and
- 4) Perfect Continuous Tense.

## Simple or Indefinite Tense

## UNIT  4. SUBJECT VERB AGREEMENT

Subject - Verb Agreement means the harmony between the subject of the sentence and the verb. The verb always follows the subject of the sentence.

## 1. A finite verb must agree its subject in person and number

Examples:

- o I am reading a book.
- o He is playing.
- o The child is playing.
- o The children are watching cartoons .

## 2. The Error of Proximity

In cases where subject and verb are separated by a long phrase or a clause, the verb agrees with the real subject and not the noun or pronoun placed next to it.

Examples:

- o The apples in the basket are fresh.
- o The strong bond of affection between the two cousins was obvious.
- o The joys one experiences in one's childhood are beyond description.

## 3. The Introductory ' There'

In a sentence beginning with there , the verb agrees with the real subject that follows there.

- o There is no proof of his involvement in this case.
- o There are major flaws in your argument.

## 4. Two or More Nouns or Pronouns joined by 'And'

(a) Subject consists of two or more nouns or pronouns joined by and- PLURAL Verb.

Examples:

- (b) The nouns refer to the same person or thing -SINGULAR Verb

Examples:

- o The director and producer of the movie was present there.
- o Rice and curry is his favorite dish.
- (c) The nouns convey the same meaning, placed together only for emphasis-Singular verb

Examples:

- o The honour and the glory of my country is uppermost in my mind.
- o The power and influence Gandhiji exerted over the Indian masses was really great.

5. Subject  consists  of  two  nouns  or  pronouns  joined  with  as  well  as,  together  with,  along  with,  in addition to: verb agrees with the first subject

Examples:

- o Mr. Das as well as his friends has escaped unhurt.
- o You as well as I are responsible for our losses.
- o The captain with othe team members was given a hearty welcome.

## 6.Two subjects joined with not only, but also: Verb agrees with the latter subject

Example:

- o Not only the principal but also the teachers have played an important role.

## 7. Two subjects joined with…or, neither…has .nor verb agreed with the latter subject

Examples:

- o Either you or Gaurav is responsible for the mistake.
- o Neither Gaurav nor you are responsible for the mistake.

## 8. One subject singular and the other plural

The pattern is: Either /Neither+ Singular sub +or/nor + Plural sub. Plural verb

## UNIT 5 Basic Sentence Patterns of English

Sentence: A sentence is a textual unit consisting of one or more words that are grammatically linked.

Here we will study basic four patterns of  English. For better understanding of the same, We need to understand the following terms.

Subject: A subject is a part of a sentence that contains the person or thing performing the action (or verb ) in a sentence. Traditionally the subject is the word or phrase which controls the verb in the clause.

- The peon rings the bell.

Verb :  Verbs are words that express action or state of being. You have studied about them in parts of speech and tenses. They are action words in the sentence.

- He runs fast.

Object : An object is a noun, a noun phrase, or a pronoun that is affected by the action of a verb.

- Ram is reading a newspaper

Adverbial: Adverbials are words that we use to give more information about a verb. They can be one word (angrily, here) or phrases (at home, in a few hours) and often say how, where, when or how often something happens or is done, though they can also have other uses..

- He  speaks fluently.
- Lata ate breakfast yesterday morning .

Complement: Complement is the term used for a word or words that are needed to complete the meaning of an expression.

- Algebra is difficult.

The following are basic four patterns to make a meaningful sentence.

## 1. S + V : Subject + Verb

- He/ laughed.
- Dogs/ bark.
- We /enjoyed.

## 2. S+V+O: Subject + Verb+ Object

- We / received / the parcel.
- Many students / witnessed / the play.
- The police / arrested / the thief

## 3. S+V+A: Subject + Verb+ Adverbial

- The train / arrived / late
- It / rained / last night
- He / reads / slowly

4. S+V+C: Subject + Verb+ Complement

- They / are / players.
- I / am / an Indian.
- Her father / is / a doctor

## SECTION 3

## PROSE AND POETRY

## Unit 1 The Leopard

## Ruskin Bond

I first saw the leopard when I was crossing  the small  stream at the bottom  of the hill.

The ravine was so deep that for most of the day it remained in shadow. This encouraged  many  birds  and animals  to  emerge  from  cover during  daylight  hours.  Few people ever passed that way: only milkmen and charcoal-burners from the surrounding villages.

As a result, the ravine had become a little haven of wildlife, one of the few natural  sanctuaries left near Mussoorie, a hill- station in northern India.

Below my  cottage  was  a  forest of  oak  and  maple  and  Himalayan  rhododendron. A  narrow path twisted its way down through the trees, over an open ridge where red sorrel grew wild, and then steeply down through a tangle of wild raspberries, creeping vines and slender bamboo.

At  the  bottom  of  the  hill  the path  led  on  to a grassy  verge,  surrounded  by  wild dog roses.  (It  is surprising  how  closely  the  flora  of  the  lower  Himalayas,  between 5,000 to  8,000 feet, resembles that of the English countryside.)

The stream ran close by the verge, tumbling  over  smooth pebbles, over  rocks  worn yellow with age, on its way to the plains and to the little Song River and finally to the sacred Ganges.

When  I first  discovered  the  stream  it  was  early  April  and  the  wild  roses  were  flowering-small white blossoms lying in clusters.

I walked down to  the stream almost every day, after  two  or  three hours of writing.

I  had  lived  in  cities  too  long,  and  had  returned  to  the  hills  to  renew  myself,  both  physically  and mentally.  Once  you  have  lived  with  mountains  for  any  length  of  time, you belong  to  them, and must return again and again.

Nearly every morning, and sometimes during the day, I heard the cry of the barking  deer. And in  the evening,  walking  through  the  forest,  I disturbed  parties  of pheasant. The  birds  went  gliding  down  the ravine  on  open,  motionless  wings. I  saw  pine martens and a handsome red fox, and I recognized the footprints of a bear.

As I had not come to take anything from the forest, the birds and animals soon grew accustomed  to  my presence;  or  possibly  they  recognized  my  footsteps. After  some time, my approach did not disturb them.

The langurs in the oak and rhododendron trees, who would at first go  leaping through  the  branches  at my approach, now watched me with some curiosity as  they  munched the tender green shoots of the oak.

The  young ones  scuffled  and  wrestled  like  boys,  while  their  parents  groomed  each  other's  coats, stretching  themselves  out  on  the  sunlit  hillside.  But  one  evening,  as I passed, I heard them chattering in the trees, and I knew I was not the cause of their excitement.

As I crossed the stream and began climbing the hill, the grunting and chattering  increased,  as  though  the langurs  were  trying  to  warn  me  of  some  hidden  danger.  A  shower of pebbles came rattling down the steep hillside, and I looked up to see a sinewy, orange-gold leopard poised on a rock about twenty feet above me.

It  was  not  looking  towards  me,  but  had  its  head  thrust  attentively  forward,  in  the direction  of  the ravine. Yet it must have  sensed my presence, because  it slowly turned its head and looked down at me.

It seemed a  little  puzzled  at my  presence  there;  and  when, to  give myself  courage,  I clapped my hands

sharply, the leopard sprang away into the thickets, making absolutely no  sound as it melted into the shadows.

I had disturbed the animal in its quest for  food. But a little after  I heard the quickening  cry  of  a barking deer  as  it fled through the forest. The hunt was  still  on.

The  leopard,  like  other  members  of  the  cat family,  is  nearing  extinction  in  India,  and  I was  surprised to find  one  so close  to Mussoorie.  Probably  the  deforestation  that  had  been  taking  place  in  the surrounding hills had driven the deer into this green valley; and the leopard, naturally, had followed.

It was some weeks before I saw the  leopard again, although I was  often made aware of its presence. A dry, rasping cough sometimes gave it away. At times I felt  almost certain that I was being followed.

Once, when I was late getting home, and the brief twilight gave way to a dark, moonless  night, I was startled by a  family of  porcupines  running  about in a  clearing.  I looked around nervously, and saw two bright eyes staring  at me  from a  thicket. I stood  still, my heart banging  away against my ribs. Then the eyes  danced away, and I  realized that they were only fireflies.

In  May  and  June,  when  the  hills  were  brown  and  dry,  it  was  always  cool  and  green near  the stream, where ferns and maidenhair and long grasses continued to thrive.

Downstream I found a small pool where I could bathe, and a cave with water dripping from the roof, the water spangled gold and silver in the shafts of sunlight  that pushed through the slits in the cave roof.

'He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.' Perhaps David had  discovered  a  similar  paradise when  he wrote those  words;  perhaps  I,  too,  would  write  good words. The hill-station's  summer  visitors had not discovered this haven of wild and green things. I was beginning to  feel  that  the place belonged to me, that dominion was mine.

The stream  had at least one other  regular  visitor, a  spotted forktail, and  though  it  did not fly away at my approach  it  became  restless  if  I  stayed  too  long,  and  then  it  would  move  from  boulder  to  boulder uttering a long complaining cry.

I  spent  an  afternoon  trying  to  discover  the  bird's  nest,  which  I  was  certain  contained  young  ones, because  I  had  seen  the  forktail  carrying  grubs  in  her  bill.  The problem  was  that  when  the  bird  flew upstream I had difficulty in following her rapidly enough as the rocks were sharp and slippery.

Eventually  I  decorated  myself  with  bracken  fronds  and,  after  slowly  making  my  way upstream,  hid myself in the hollow stump of a tree at a spot where the forktail often  disappeared. I had  no  intention of  robbing  the  bird: I was  simply curious  to  see  its home.

By crouching down, I was able to command a view of a small stretch of the stream and the sides of the  ravine;  but  I  had  done  little  to  deceive  the  forktail,  who continued  to  object  strongly  to  my presence so near her home.

I  summoned  up  my  reserves  of  patience  and  sat  perfectly  still  for  about  ten  minutes.  The  forktail quietened  down.  Out  of  sight,  out  of  mind.  But  where  had  she  gone?  Probably  into  the  walls  of  the ravine  where I felt sure, she was  guarding  her  nest.

I  decided  to  take  her  by  surprise,  and  stood  up  suddenly,  in  time  to  see  not  the  forktail  on  her doorstep,  but  the  leopard  bounding  away  with  a  grunt  of  surprise! Two  urgent springs, and  it had crossed the stream and plunged into the forest.

I  was  as  astonished  as  the  leopard,  and  forgot  all  about  the  forktail  and  her  nest.  Had the leopard been following me again? I decided against this possibility. Only man-eaters  follow  humans,  and,  as far  as  I knew, there had never  been a man-eater  in the vicinity of Mussoorie.

During the monsoon the stream became a rushing torrent, bushes and small trees were  swept away, and the friendly murmur  of  the water  became a threatening  boom.  I did not visit the place too often, as there were leeches in the long grass.

One day I found the  remains  of  a  barking  deer  which  had  only  been  partly  eaten. I  wondered why the

leopard had not hidden the rest of his meal, and decided that it must have been disturbed while eating.

Then, climbing the hill, I met a party of hunters resting beneath the oaks. They asked me if I had seen a leopard. I said I had not. They said they knew there was a leopard in the forest.

Leopard skins, they told me, were selling  in Delhi  at over  1,000 rupees each. Of course there was a ban on the export of skins, but they gave me to understand that there  were  ways  and  means. . . . I thanked them for  their  information and walked on,  feeling uneasy and disturbed.

The hunters had seen the carcass of the deer, and they had seen the leopard's pug-  marks,  and  they  kept coming  to  the  forest. Almost  every  evening  I  heard  their  guns  banging  away; for  they were ready to fire at almost anything.

'There's  a  leopard about,' they always  told me. 'You should carry a  gun.'  'I don't have one,' I said. There  were  fewer  birds  to  be  seen,  and  even  the  langurs  had  moved  on.  The  red  fox  did  not  show itself; and the pine martens, who had become quite bold, now dashed into  hiding, at my approach. The smell  of  one human is  like the smell  of  any  other.

And then the rains were over and it was October; I could lie in the sun, on sweet- smelling grass, and gaze up through a pattern of oak leaves into a blinding blue heaven. And I would praise God for  leaves and grass  and the smell  of  things, the smell  of  mint and  bruised  clover,  and  the  touch  of  things-the touch of  grass  and air  and sky, the touch of the sky's blueness.

I thought no more of the men. My attitude towards them was similar to that of the denizens  of  the  forest. These were men, unpredictable, and to  be  avoided  if  possible.

On the  other  side  of  the  ravine  rose  Pari  Tibba,  Hill  of  the  Fairies: a  bleak,  scrub-  covered hill where no one lived.

It  was  said  that  in  the  previous  century  Englishmen  had  tried  building  their  houses  on the hill, but the area had always attracted lightning, due to either the hill's location or due to its mineral deposits; after several houses had been struck by lightning, the settlers had moved on to the next hill, where the town now stands.

To the hillmen it is Pari Tibba, haunted by the spirits of a pair of ill-fated lovers  who perished there in a storm; to others it is known as Burnt Hill, because of its scarred and stunted trees.

One day, after crossing the stream, I climbed Pari Tibba-a stiff undertaking, because  there  was  no path  to  the  top  and  I  had  to  scramble  up  a  precipitous  rock-face  with the help of rocks and roots that were apt to come loose in my groping hand.

But  at  the  top  was  a  plateau  with  a  few  pine  trees,  their  upper  branches  catching  the  wind  and humming softly. There I found the ruins of what must have been the houses  of  the  first settlers-just a few piles  of  rubble,  now overgrown  with  weeds,  sorrel, dandelions and nettles.

As I walked through the roofless ruins, I was struck by the silence  that surrounded me, the absence of birds and animals, the sense of complete desolation.

The  silence  was  so  absolute  that it seemed  to  be  ringing  in  my  ears. But there  was  something else of which I was becoming increasingly aware: the strong feline odour of one of the cat family.

I paused and looked about. I was alone. There was no movement of  dry leaf  or loose  stone. The  ruins were for  the most part open to  the sky. Their  rotting  rafters had collapsed, jamming together to form a low passage like the entrance to a mine;  and this dark cavern seemed to lead down into the ground.

The smell was stronger when I approached this spot, so I stopped again and waited  there,  wondering if  I  had  discovered  the  lair  of  the  leopard,  wondering  if  the animal was now at rest after  a night's hunt.

Perhaps he was crouching there in the dark, watching me, recognizing  me,  knowing me as the man who walked alone in the forest without a weapon.

I  like  to  think  that  he  was  there,  that  he  knew  me,  and  that  he  acknowledged  my visit  in  the

friendliest way: by ignoring me altogether.

Perhaps  I had made  him  confident-too  confident, too  careless,  too  trusting  of  the  human in his  midst. I did not venture any further;  I was not out of my mind. I did not seek physical contact, or even another glimpse of that beautiful sinewy body, springing  from  rock  to  rock. It  was  his  trust  I  wanted,  and  I think he gave it to  me.

But  did  the  leopard,  trusting  one  man,  make  the  mistake  of  bestowing  his  trust  on  others?  Did  I,  by casting  out all  fear-my own fear, and the leopard's  protective fear -leave him defenseless?

Because next day, coming up the path from the stream, shouting and beating drums, were  the hunters. They  had  a  long  bamboo  pole  across  their  shoulders;  and slung  from  the  pole,  feet  up,  head  down, was the lifeless  body of the  leopard, shot in   the neck and in the head.

'We told you there was a leopard!' they shouted, in great good humour. 'Isn't he a  fine specimen?'

'Yes,' I said. 'He was a beautiful leopard.'

I walked home  through the  silent forest. It was  very  silent,  almost as  though  the  birds and animals knew that their trust had been violated.

I  remembered  the  lines  of  a  poem  by  D. H. Lawrence;  and,  as  I climbed  the  steep  and lonely path to my home, the words beat out their rhythm in my mind: 'There was room in the world for a mountain lion and me.'

## UNIT 2 After Twenty Years

## O'Henry

The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few. The time was barely 10 o'clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh depeopled the streets.

Trying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye  adown the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed.

When about  midway of  a  certain  block  the  policeman  suddenly  slowed  his  walk.  In  the  doorway  of  a  darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the policeman walked up to him the man spoke up quickly.

"It's all right, officer," he said, reassuringly. "I'm just waiting for a friend. It's an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little funny to you, doesn't it? Well, I'll explain if you'd like to make certain it's all straight. About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands--'Big Joe' Brady's restaurant."

"Until five years ago," said the policeman. "It was torn down then."

The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set.

"Twenty years ago to-night," said the man, "I dined here at 'Big Joe' Brady's with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers, together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn't have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well, we agreed that night that we would meet here  again  exactly  twenty  years  from  that  date  and  time,  no  matter  what  our  conditions  might  be  or  from  what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made, whatever they were going to be."

"It  sounds  pretty  interesting,"  said  the  policeman.  "Rather  a  long  time  between  meets,  though,  it  seems  to  me. Haven't you heard from your friend since you left?"

"Well, yes, for a time we corresponded," said the other. "But after a year or two we lost track of each other. You see, the West is a pretty big proposition, and I kept hustling around over it pretty lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he's alive, for he always was the truest, stanchest old chap in the world. He'll never forget. I came a thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it's worth it if my old partner turns up."

The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with small diamonds.

"Three minutes to ten," he announced. "It was exactly ten o'clock when we parted here at the restaurant door."

"Did pretty well out West, didn't you?" asked the policeman.

"You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder, though, good fellow as he was. I've had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York. It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him."

The policeman twirled his club and took a step or two. "I'll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to call time on him sharp?"

"I should say not!" said the other. "I'll give him half an hour at least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he'll be here by that time. So long, officer."

"Good-night, sir," said the policeman, passing on along his beat, trying doors as he went.

There was now a fine, cold drizzle falling, and the wind had risen from its uncertain puffs into a steady blow. The few foot passengers astir in that quarter hurried dismally and silently along with coat collars turned high and pocketed hands.  And  in  the  door  of  the  hardware  store  the  man  who  had  come  a  thousand  miles  to  fill  an  appointment, uncertain almost to absurdity,  with the friend of his youth, smoked his cigar and waited.

About twenty minutes he waited, and then a tall man in a long overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.

"Is that you, Bob?" he asked, doubtfully.

"Is that you, Jimmy Wells?" cried the man in the door.

"Bless my heart!" exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other's hands with his own. "It's Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I'd find you here if you were still in existence. Well, well, well--twenty years is a long time. The old gone, Bob; I wish it had lasted, so we could have had another dinner there. How has the West treated you, old man?"

"Bully; it has given me everything I asked it for. You've changed lots, Jimmy. I never thought you were so tall by two or three inches." 4

"Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty." "Doing well in New York, Jimmy?"

"Moderately. I have a position in one of the city departments. Come on, Bob; we'll go around to a place I know of, and have a good long talk about old times."

The  two  men  started  up  the  street,  arm  in  arm.  The  man  from  the  West,  his  egotism  enlarged  by  success,  was beginning to outline the history of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest.

At the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other's face.

The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.

"You're not Jimmy Wells," he snapped. "Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change a man's nose

"It  sometimes changes a good man into a bad one," said the tall man. "You've been under arrest for ten minutes, 'Silky' Bob. Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you. Going quietly, are you? That's sensible. Now, before we go on to the station here's a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it here at the window. It's from Patrolman Wells."

The man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him. His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the time he had finished. The note was rather short.

"Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago. Somehow I couldn't do it myself, so I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job.'

JIMMY.

## UNIT 3 Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening

Whose woods these are I think I know. His house is in the village though; He will not see me stopping here To watch his woods fill up with snow.

My little horse must think it queer To stop without a farmhouse near Between the woods and frozen lake The darkest evening of the year.

He gives his harness bells a shake To ask if there is some mistake. The only other sound's the sweep Of easy wind and downy flake.

The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep

## Email Format

Let us look at the important steps to follow when writing a formal email.

## 1. Subject line

Grab attention with the subject line. The first part of an email which your recipient sees is the subject of the email. If you do not put it well, you risk having your email not opened until later or at all. Here are some things to keep in mind:

- Make the  subject  line specific, report you asked for' , write, 'Internsh simple,  and  to  the  point .  For  example,  instead  of ip Report, {date/week/month}' . 'The  internship
- The subject line should be short . Ideally, your subject line should stand around six words.
- Keep the most important and informative words in the beginning of the subject line.
- Use markers like Fwd, Reply, Urgent reader about the nature of your email. , or Notice to further narrow down the subject. It informs your

Some of the examples of good subject lines in formal emails can be:

Marketing Data for July 2018

- Marketing Budget, October 2018
- List of New Freelancers
- Job Application for the Post of XYZ
- Leave Application
- Query Regarding the Missing Information in the Document
- Contract Agreement - XYZ Assignment

## 2. Salutation

Each email is directed towards someone. Start your formal email with addressing the recipient in a manner fitting the relationship you have with them.

For people you are unfamiliar with or do not know the names of, use ' To Whom It May Concern ' or ' Dear sir/madam '.

For senior officials, stick to their designation or follow it with their name, for example, ' To the Manager ', ' Dear Dr. Ghosh ', or ' Dear Ms. Kapoor '.

Among colleagues, it may be appropriate to simply precede the name with a ' Hi'.

Do not skip the salutation and always be respectful. Never use nicknames or just surnames or first names in a formal email.

## 3. Body of the email

The body text is the main part of your email. It is important to follow a certain pattern when writing the body of your email.

- The opening paragraph should set the tone and reason for your email. Introduce yourself if you are a stranger to the person you are writing to, and jot down why you are writing to them.
- For example, you can begin with ' My name is Abc, and this email is with reference to Xyz.' or ' This is with reference to the marketing budget as discussed in the meeting. '
- Elaborate on your concern, question, or response as comprehensively as possible. Write in a way that is easy to understand, but at the same time, do not lose your point in providing unnecessary information. Say only what is required.
- The closing of the email should also support the nature of your email. If you are asking a question, close with something like ' Hope to have an answer from you soon ', or 'Looking forward to hearing from you soon ', and if you are addressing a question, end with ' Hope I have sufficiently answered your query/doubts.'
- Signature
- These are the last words of your email, capable of forming a lasting impression on your reader.
- Sign off with a simple word or phrase, which conveys respect. Safe choices are 'Best regards', 'Warmly', 'Sincerely', 'Kind regards' , or simply 'Thanks' .
- If you are writing to someone for the first time or someone who is not an immediate colleague or senior, use your full name.

- Furnish your name with contact information. Your phone number and/or work address are enough.
- If you are writing on behalf of or as an employee of an institution, make sure to mention it along with adequate contact details
- To make your signature even more effective, you may also choose or design an attractive (but not flashy) template.

## Formal Email Samples

Formal emails are sent in a whole variety of situations. While they use the same rules, they may have to be modified according to their purpose.

Now that you are familiar with the format of a formal email, let us have a look at few email samples.

## Business Letters

A business  letter is  a  letter  from  one  company  to  another,  or  between  such  organizations  and  their customers, clients, or other external parties. The overall style of letter depends on the relationship between the  parties  concerned.  Business  letters  can  have  many  types  of  content,  for  example  to  request  direct information or action from another party, to order supplies from a supplier, to point out a mistake by the letter's recipient, to reply directly to a request, to apologize for a wrong, or to convey goodwill. A business letter  is  useful  because  it  produces  a  permanent  written  record,  and  may  be  taken  more  seriously  by  the recipient than other forms of communication.

## Qualities of a Good Letter

The 7 Cs of business communication which make it are:

1. Clarity
2. Correctness
3. Conciseness
4. Courtesy
5. Concreteness
6. Consideration
7. Completeness

## #1: Clarity

Practicing clarity in your communication ensures that the message is received accurately. You should know what you wish to say and how to say it. Use language that can be easily understood, and resist the temptation to include unnecessary information.

## Example

Instead of saying, 'We have considered the consequences of the existing policy on the hiring strategies we employ with our human resources department and updated them accordingly,' say, 'We have updated our hiring policy.'

## #2: Correctness

You must communicate with correctness - correct grammar, language, data, etc. In written communication, you should proofread before sending.

Example:

'You may enter the building during opening hours but must show relevant I.D.'

Immediately, the recipient of this information has two questions:

- 'What are the opening hours, and what ID is considered relevant?

Correctness in this communication is conveyed by saying, 'You may enter the building during the opening hours of 9am to 5pm daily, but must show your employee identity card.'

## #3: Conciseness

Never use more words than is necessary. Brevity is more easily understood, though you must avoid discourtesy. Concise messages save you and the recipient time, too. To be concise, follow these rules:

- Eliminate unnecessary words

- Use action verbs
- Remove repetition

## Example

'As a matter of fact, during the month of June, all employees must ensure that they wear appropriate clothing to ensure they stay cool while the air-conditioning is being repaired.'

## Becomes

'Indeed, during June, employees must wear appropriate clothing to stay cool while the air-conditioning is repaired.'

## #4: Courtesy

Employ courtesy when communicating. This shows you respect the recipient and helps to build goodwill. You must ensure that you are sincere, thoughtful, and do not use discriminatory language.

## Example

- 'I don't appreciate how your team ignores requests for collaboration from my team. The work we do is equally as important as your work. Could you make certain that your team collaborates more readily from now on?'

Such a message is unlikely to encourage a negative response. Instead, a more effective approach would be:

'I understand that your team is extremely busy and receives many requests to collaborate on project work. However, my team is working a highly urgent project with enormous mutual benefits. I would greatly appreciate if you could ask your team to collaborate more effectively with mine to move this project forward faster. If there is any help that we can provide to make this happen, please let me know.'

## 5: Concreteness

Concrete communication is specific, clear, and meaningful. It avoids vagueness, uses available facts and figures to add authenticity, and builds around an active voice.

Example:

An example would be poor communication of underperformance during a one-to-one. You might say, 'Your sales numbers are on the low side. They need to be improved to at least the team's average.'

Give your employee concrete direction with evidence and an active voice:

'Your sales conversion rate is below 50%. You must improve this to the team average of 65% or higher.'

## 6: Consideration

Be considerate with your messaging by putting yourself in the position of the recipient. Focus on communicating to 'you', considering needs and issues experienced by the recipient.

## Example

Imagine that you are unable to pay a promised bonus. How do you communicate this?

'We are unable to pay bonuses now. The business is awaiting payment from a major client. Once this payment is received, we can consider paying contractual bonuses as soon as is practicable.'

This could be better conveyed as follows:

'Unfortunately, we are not presently in the position to pay your bonus. However, as soon as our major client has settled their account, we will pay any bonuses owed to you. We're sorry about this delay, but are sure you understand our need for positive cash flow and the long-term benefits this will deliver to you.'

## 7: Completeness

Your message should be complete, delivering all the facts needed for the recipient to make an informed decision. Incomplete messages often receive poor responses.

To ensure your communication is complete, ask if it answers the what, when, why, who, where, and how.

Example:

'You haven't completed the task that I set you,' is a message full of ambiguity. Instead, make sure you include all relevant facts:

'The data analysis for client ABC that I asked for on March 5 should have been completed by today. Will you have it finished this afternoon?'

## Format

A business letter must include:

## 1. Address

The address of the person receiving the correspondence includes a formal name, street address, city, state, and pin code.

## 2. Date

The date is put for any business communication.

The date is a critical piece of information documenting when the correspondence was sent.

This is important for correspondence that may be kept for future reference.

## 3. Subject Line

This indicates the subject of the letter so the receiver gets the idea what is the letter about.

## 4. Salutation

The salutation is the formal way of addressing the person.

Common salutations are Dear or To Whom It May Concern.

## 5. Introduction

The first few sentences of a letter are introductory.

The introduction section introduces the subject of the letter.

It is a summary in a sentence or two that explains the goal of the letter.

For example, an introduction may be something like:

I am writing today to further explore a vendor relationship with XYZ Corporation.

## 6. Body of the Letter

The body of the letter is where the bulk of the information is shared.

The body of the letter explains in detail all aspects of what is being communicated.

This would include detail of the information being shared.

For instance, the body may be something like this:

We understand that XYZ Corporation can provide tools for 10% less than other competitors. And, that the focus on service after the sale is amongst the best in the industry.

## 7. Closing

The closing of the letter summarizes what the letter was about and any next steps or action items.

This section gives the reader a heads up that the communication is coming to a close.

For instance, the closing may be something like this:

Please call me at your earliest convenience to discuss a vendor relationship and to explore if we can come to a mutually beneficial relationship. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

## 8. Signature

The signature section has a complimentary closing.

Examples are Sincerely, Warmest Regards, Respectfully Yours, Very Truly Yours, or Cordially Yours.

Be sure to gauge the audience when selecting a complimentary closing.

After the complimentary closing, space is left for the signature that goes above the typed name and title of the person sending the letter.
