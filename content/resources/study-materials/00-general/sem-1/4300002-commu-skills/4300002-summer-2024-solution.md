Subject: Complaint Regarding Damaged Furniture Delivery - Order No. [Order Number]

Dear Sir/Madam,

We regret to inform you that we have received damaged furniture items in our recent order (Order No. [Order Number]) delivered on [Delivery Date].

Upon inspection, we found the following items damaged:

1. Executive Desk (Model: GF-ED1001, Serial No. [Number]) - Scratches on the surface and a broken drawer
2. Staff Chairs (Model: GF-SC4004) - 3 units with damaged armrests
3. File Cabinet (Model: GF-FC7007) - Dent on the right side panel

This is particularly disappointing as we needed these items urgently for our newly established office. The damage has caused inconvenience and delayed our office setup.

We request you to:
- Replace the damaged items at the earliest possible date, or
- Offer appropriate compensation/discount for the damaged goods

We have preserved the original packaging and have photographic evidence of the damage, which can be provided if required.

We have been a loyal customer of GLOBAL FURNITURE and expect a prompt resolution to this matter.

Yours sincerely,
