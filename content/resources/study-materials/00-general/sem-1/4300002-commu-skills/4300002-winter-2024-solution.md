   **Answer**: A. Barriers

4. The response to a sender's message is called ____.
   **Answer**: D. Feedback

## Question 1(b) [4 marks]

**Answer the following questions: (Any Four)**

1. **How can you explain the term 'communication'?**

   **Answer**:
   Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, and feelings between individuals through a common system of symbols, signs, or behaviors. It involves a sender transmitting a message through a channel to a receiver who provides feedback.

2. **What can you infer from the term 'encoding'?**

   **Answer**:
   Encoding is the process of converting thoughts and ideas into symbols, words, or gestures that the receiver can understand. It's how the sender transforms the message into a suitable format before transmission through the selected communication channel.

3. **How will you contrast 'verbal communication' and 'non-verbal communication'?**

   **Answer**:
   
   **Table: Verbal vs. Non-verbal Communication**

   | Verbal Communication | Non-verbal Communication |
   |---------------------|--------------------------|
   | Uses words (spoken or written) | Uses body language, gestures, expressions |
   | Can be direct and explicit | Often unconscious and implicit |
   | Limited by language barriers | Transcends language barriers |
   | Primarily conveys information | Primarily conveys emotions and attitudes |

4. **How would you summarise the term 'paralanguage'?**

   **Answer**:
   Paralanguage refers to how we say things rather than what we say. It includes voice qualities (pitch, tone, volume), vocal characterizers (laughing, crying), vocal qualifiers (intensity, rhythm), and vocal segregates (fillers like "um," "ah"). These elements add emotional context to verbal communication.

5. **If a listener does not know/understand a speaker's language, what kind of barrier will it be called?**

   **Answer**:
   This is a semantic barrier or language barrier. It occurs when the sender and receiver use different languages, specialized terminology, or jargon that prevents effective understanding of the message's intended meaning.

## Question 1(c) [7 marks]

**Answer the following questions: (Any Seven)**

1. **What must the horse find 'queer'?**

   **Answer**:
   In "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," the horse finds it strange (queer) that the speaker has stopped "without a farmhouse near" in the dark woods. The horse is confused by the unscheduled stop in an uninhabited area, especially during a snowy evening.

2. **"He gives his harness bells a shake" – Who is 'he'?**

   **Answer**:
   'He' refers to the horse in the poem. The horse shakes its harness bells as if questioning why they've stopped in the middle of nowhere, reminding the speaker of their responsibilities and journey ahead.

3. **What does Tagore suggest through the phrase "mind is without fear"?**

   **Answer**:
   Through the phrase "mind is without fear," Tagore suggests a society where people can think and express themselves freely without intimidation or oppression. He envisions citizens who aren't afraid to voice their opinions or embrace new ideas due to political, social, or religious pressure.

4. **Whom does Tagore address as 'my Father'?**

   **Answer**:
   Tagore addresses God as 'my Father' in the poem "Where the Mind is Without Fear." This spiritual invocation shows Tagore seeking divine help to achieve his vision of a free, enlightened nation where reason and truth prevail.

5. **What was the appointment made between Bob and Jimmy before twenty years?**

   **Answer**:
   Bob and Jimmy had made an appointment to meet at the same spot (outside what was Big Joe Brady's restaurant) exactly twenty years later at 10 PM, regardless of where life took them. This agreement was made over their last dinner together before parting ways.

6. **Why was Bob under arrest?**

   **Answer**:
   Bob was under arrest because he was a wanted criminal from Chicago. During their twenty years apart, while Jimmy had become a policeman, Bob had chosen a life of crime and had become a notorious criminal with a wanted status, which Jimmy had discovered during his police duty.

7. **What examples of nature can you find to justify 'The Leopard' as a nature-centric prose?**

   **Answer**:
   "The Leopard" contains numerous nature elements: the mountain stream, forktail bird, ravine ecosystem, the leopard itself, jungle sounds, seasonal changes, and descriptions of natural habitats. The author's detailed observations of flora and fauna and their interdependence create a rich nature-centric narrative.

8. **Why were the shikaris roaming in the forest?**

   **Answer**:
   The shikaris (hunters) were roaming in the forest to hunt and kill the leopard and other wild animals. This represents the human threat to wildlife that the author disapproves of, highlighting the conflict between human encroachment and wildlife preservation.

## OR

**Answer the following questions: (Any Seven)**

1. **Which season is described in 'Stopping by Woods'?**

   **Answer**:
   Winter season is described in "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening." This is evident from descriptions of snowfall ("woods fill up with snow"), the "darkest evening of the year" suggesting winter solstice, and the frozen lake mentioned in the poem.

2. **Which promises does the poet talk about in 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'?**

   **Answer**:
   The poet doesn't specify what promises he refers to in the line "And miles to go before I sleep." These likely represent social obligations, responsibilities, and commitments that demand his attention. The repeated line emphasizes both literal journey distance and figurative life commitments.

3. **What does the poet mean by "knowledge is free"?**

   **Answer**:
   By "knowledge is free," Tagore envisions a society where education and information are accessible to everyone regardless of social status, caste, gender, or economic condition. He dreams of learning without boundaries, where ideas flow freely without restrictive traditions or prejudices.

4. **What is meant by "narrow domestic walls"?**

   **Answer**:
   "Narrow domestic walls" refers to artificial divisions based on religion, caste, class, language, and region that separate people within a country. Tagore criticizes these artificial barriers that fragment society and hinder national unity and human connection.

5. **How did Bob realise that the cop was not Jimmy?**

   **Answer**:
   Bob realized the cop wasn't Jimmy when the plainclothes officer (the real policeman who arrested him) mentioned that Jimmy had sent him. Additionally, the plainclothes officer matched Jimmy's description of his friend, revealing the uniformed cop had been Jimmy in disguise who couldn't arrest his friend himself.

6. **What does the phrase 'guardian of peace' mean?**

   **Answer**:
   The phrase "guardian of peace" in "After Twenty Years" refers to Jimmy Wells' role as a police officer. It highlights his duty to uphold law and order, protect citizens, and maintain social peace and safety, which ultimately conflicts with his personal loyalty to his friend Bob.

7. **What was the author's attitude towards man in 'The Leopard'?**

   **Answer**:
   In "The Leopard," the author held a critical attitude toward humans who disturbed or harmed wildlife. He disapproved of hunters (shikaris), expressed concern about human encroachment on natural habitats, and preferred animals' company over humans'. He valued people who respected nature's balance.

8. **How was the ravine?**

   **Answer**:
   The ravine in "The Leopard" was described as a deep, secluded valley with a stream running through it. It featured dense vegetation, rocks, and served as a natural habitat for various wildlife including the leopard and forktail. The author portrayed it as a peaceful, untouched sanctuary away from human interference.

### 1. Shannon-Weaver model of communication

**Answer**:
The Shannon-Weaver model explains how information transfers from sender to receiver.

**Diagram:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Information Source] --> B[Transmitter/Encoder]
    B --> C[Channel]
    C --> D[Receiver/Decoder]
    D --> E[Destination]
    F[Noise Source] --> C
```

- **Information Source**: Creates and decides what message to send
- **Encoder/Transmitter**: Converts message into signals or code
- **Channel**: Medium through which message travels
- **Decoder/Receiver**: Converts signals back into understandable message
- **Destination**: Person receiving and interpreting the message
- **Noise**: Interference that disrupts clear transmission

Originally designed for technical communication, this model applies to all forms of human interaction, showing communication as a linear process subject to external interference.

**Mnemonic:** "Source Encodes, Channel Carries, Destination Decodes"

### 2. Facial expressions and Eye contact

**Answer**:
Facial expressions and eye contact are powerful forms of non-verbal communication that often convey emotions more authentically than words.

**Table: Key Aspects of Facial Expressions and Eye Contact**

| Aspect | Function | Cultural Considerations |
|--------|----------|-------------------------|
| Facial Expressions | Convey emotions (happiness, sadness, anger, surprise) | Some expressions universal, others culture-specific |
| Eye Contact | Shows attention, confidence, interest | Duration and intensity vary by culture |
| Micro-expressions | Brief, involuntary expressions revealing true feelings | Often last less than 1/25 of a second |
| Eye Movement | Direction of gaze indicates thinking patterns | Left/right movements connect to brain activity |

These non-verbal cues provide critical context to verbal messages, often revealing true feelings when words might be deceptive. Research shows facial expressions constitute about 55% of the emotional impact in face-to-face communication.

**Mnemonic:** "Face Shows What Words Can't Tell"

## Question 4(b) [4 marks]

## Question 4(c) [7 marks]

**Write short notes: (Any Two)**

### 1. The poet's dilemma and decision in 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'

**Answer**:
In Robert Frost's poem, the speaker faces a momentary conflict between pausing to appreciate natural beauty and fulfilling responsibilities.

**Table: The Poet's Dilemma**

| Dilemma Aspect | Represented By | Resolution |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Attraction to Beauty | "Lovely, dark and deep" woods | Temporary enjoyment |
| Practical Reality | Horse's impatience, shaking bells | Acknowledgment |
| Social Obligations | "Promises to keep" | Takes precedence |
| Inner Conflict | Repeated "miles to go before I sleep" | Decision to continue journey |

The poet is drawn to the tranquil beauty of the snow-filled woods but recognizes that life's responsibilities cannot be ignored indefinitely. This represents the universal human dilemma between appreciating life's moments of beauty and fulfilling obligations.

The decision to move on, indicated by "miles to go before I sleep," shows the poet choosing duty over momentary pleasure, though the repetition of this line suggests a lingering reluctance.

**Mnemonic:** "Beauty Beckons, Duty Calls, Journey Continues"

### 2. The concept of 'heaven' as expressed

**Answer**:
In "Where the Mind is Without Fear," Tagore envisions his ideal "heaven of freedom" not as an afterlife destination but as a transformed nation.

**Table: Attributes of Tagore's "Heaven of Freedom"**

| Characteristic | Line from Poem | Meaning |
|----------------|----------------|---------|
| Fearless Thinking | "Where the mind is without fear" | Intellectual freedom |
| Dignity | "Head is held high" | Self-respect, pride |
| Knowledge Access | "Knowledge is free" | Education for all, regardless of status |
| No Divisions | "Not broken up by narrow domestic walls" | Unity beyond caste, religion, region |
| Truth-Seeking | "Words come out from the depth of truth" | Honesty, integrity in expression |
| Rational Thought | "Clear stream of reason" | Logic over superstition |
| Purposeful Action | "Tireless striving stretches its arms" | Progressive action, hard work |
| Perfection-Seeking | "Into that heaven of freedom" | Continuous self-improvement |

Tagore's concept represents a socio-political ideal where citizens live with dignity and purpose, guided by reason rather than fear or prejudice. This "heaven" is attainable on earth through collective enlightenment and societal reform.

**Mnemonic:** "Freedom, Unity, Reason, Truth, Perfection"

### 3. The key message of 'The Leopard'

**Answer**:
Ruskin Bond's "The Leopard" conveys powerful messages about human-nature relationships and coexistence.

**Table: Key Messages in "The Leopard"**

| Message | Evidence in Story | Significance |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|
| Mutual Respect | Leopard and author's peaceful encounters | Coexistence is possible |
| Environmental Conservation | Author's criticism of hunters | Protection of wildlife |
| Patience & Observation | Author's quiet study of animals | Understanding nature requires time |
| Human Impact | Shikaris threatening wildlife | Human activity endangers nature |
| Nature's Beauty | Detailed descriptions of ravine ecosystem | Appreciating wilderness |

The story advocates for a deeper connection with nature through careful observation rather than domination or exploitation. It suggests that wild animals deserve respect and protection, not fear or hunting.

The leopard symbolizes both the majesty and vulnerability of nature, while the author represents the potential for humans to appreciate wildlife without harming it. This message of conservation and coexistence remains relevant today amid environmental challenges.

**Mnemonic:** "Respect Nature, Protect Wildlife, Observe Patiently"

## Question 4(c) [7 marks]

**Write short notes: (Any Two)**

### 1. The author's pain and concern in 'The Leopard'

**Answer**:
In "The Leopard," Ruskin Bond expresses deep emotional distress and environmental concern regarding human impacts on wildlife.

**Table: Author's Pain and Concern**

| Aspect | Manifestation | Significance |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Hunter Threat | Author's anxiety about shikaris | Direct threat to leopard's survival |
| Habitat Destruction | Descriptions of changing landscape | Loss of natural ecosystem |
| Human Encroachment | Increased human presence near ravine | Disruption of animal habitats |
| Endangered Wildlife | Special focus on the leopard's vulnerability | Symbol of threatened nature |
| Environmental Ethics | Criticism of hunting practices | Moral questioning of human actions |

The author's pain stems from witnessing the gradual destruction of a natural paradise and the threat to creatures he has come to respect. His particular concern for the leopard represents broader anxiety about humanity's relationship with nature.

The emotional tone shifts from appreciation of beauty to fear for its survival, creating a powerful environmental message. This concern resonates today amid accelerating habitat loss and species extinction.

**Mnemonic:** "Witness, Worry, Warn about Wildlife Threats"

### 2. Friendship Vs. Duty in 'After Twenty Years'

**Answer**:
O. Henry's "After Twenty Years" presents a powerful moral conflict between personal loyalty and professional obligation.

**Table: Friendship vs. Duty Conflict**

| Aspect | Friendship Side | Duty Side |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Bob's Perspective | Traveled miles to keep twenty-year promise | Unaware of moral dilemma |
| Jimmy's Perspective | Values old friendship, can't face arrest | Policeman obligated to uphold law |
| Resolution | Note explains situation, personal touch | Another officer makes the arrest |
| Symbolic Meaning | Past bonds, personal loyalty | Present responsibilities, social order |
| Narrative Impact | Creates story's emotional depth | Drives the ironic twist |

The story presents no easy resolution to this ethical dilemma. Jimmy finds a compromise by arranging for another officer to make the arrest while explaining his actions in a note, showing respect for both friendship and duty.

O. Henry uses this conflict to explore how life choices can transform relationships and create impossible situations where personal and professional values collide. The story resonates because this tension between individual connections and societal responsibilities is universally experienced.

**Mnemonic:** "Promises from Past, Present Principles Prevail"

### 3. The central idea of 'Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening'

**Answer**:
Robert Frost's poem explores the tension between momentary appreciation of beauty and ongoing life responsibilities.

**Table: Central Ideas in the Poem**

| Theme | Evidence | Deeper Meaning |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Natural Beauty | "Woods fill up with snow," "lovely, dark and deep" | Attraction to tranquility and wilderness |
| Responsibilities | "Promises to keep," "miles to go" | Life's ongoing obligations |
| Momentary Pause | Stopping between "woods and frozen lake" | Brief respite from life's journey |
| Inner Conflict | Horse's questioning bell shake | Tension between desire and duty |
| Life Journey | Repeated "miles to go before I sleep" | Continuing path through life toward death |

The central idea revolves around life's brief moments of contemplation amid constant movement toward obligations. The speaker pauses to appreciate beauty but acknowledges the impossibility of remaining in that moment indefinitely.

The repetition of "miles to go before I sleep" carries dual meaning - both the literal journey ahead and the figurative "sleep" of death, suggesting the continuation of life's responsibilities until the end. This creates a meditation on mortality, duty, and the fleeting nature of experience.

**Mnemonic:** "Pause, Ponder, Proceed with Purpose"

- Anticipating potential questions and addressing them proactively
- Including appropriate supporting documents or references

Both principles work together to create effective communication that builds positive relationships while ensuring practical needs are met.

## Question 5(b) [4 marks]

**Do as directed: (Any One)**

### 1. Summarise the terms 'Inside address' and 'Complimentary Close'.

**Answer**:
Inside address and complimentary close are essential components of business letter formatting that serve specific functions.

**Table: Inside Address and Complimentary Close**

| Component | Position | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| Inside Address | Left-aligned, after sender's address & date | Identifies recipient | The Manager, ABC Company, City |
| Complimentary Close | Before signature, aligned with date | Formal ending | Yours sincerely, Yours faithfully |

**Inside Address** appears after the sender's address and date in a business letter. It includes:

- Recipient's name and title (if known)
- Company/organization name
- Complete postal address
- Positioned at the left margin

It serves to identify who will receive the letter and provides necessary information for mailing. The format should match the envelope address exactly.

**Complimentary Close** is the formal ending of a letter that appears before the sender's signature. Common forms include:

- "Yours sincerely" (when recipient's name is known)
- "Yours faithfully" (when addressing by title: "Dear Sir/Madam")
- "Yours truly" (alternative formal closing)

It maintains professional tone and follows standard business etiquette. Only the first word is capitalized, and it always ends with a comma.

**Mnemonic:** "Address Who Receives, Close Before You Sign"

### 2. Draft an email to the Manager of GrowRich Bank, A.G. Road Branch, Delhi to complain about the disrespectful behavior of a staff at the bank.

**Answer**:

```
From: [Your Email]
To: manager@growrichbank-agroad.com
Subject: Complaint Regarding Staff Behavior at A.G. Road Branch

Dear Manager,

Account Number: [Your Account Number]
Visit Date: January 1, 2025
Time: Approximately 11:30 AM

I am writing to express my disappointment regarding the unprofessional behavior I experienced during my recent visit to your A.G. Road Branch on January 1, 2025.

I visited the branch to update my KYC details and inquire about a home loan. While waiting for my turn at counter number 4, the staff member (with name tag "Mr. [Name]") addressed me in a dismissive tone when I asked about the documentation requirements. When I requested clarification on certain forms, he made several condescending remarks in front of other customers, stating that "everyone knows this basic information" and visibly displaying impatience.

This treatment was not only embarrassing but also contradicts the customer service standards I have come to expect from GrowRich Bank over my eight years as a loyal customer.

I request that this matter be investigated and appropriate action be taken to ensure such incidents do not recur. I would appreciate receiving:
1. An acknowledgment of this complaint
2. Information about the steps taken to address this issue
3. Assurance that bank staff receive proper training in customer interaction

I hope this matter receives your prompt attention. I can be reached at [Your Phone Number] should you need any additional information.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

[Your Full Name]
Account Holder

Despite the payment being processed immediately, I have not received the product, nor has there been any communication from your end regarding the delay.

This situation has caused significant inconvenience as I urgently need this laptop for my professional work. I have made several attempts to contact your customer service at 1800-XXX-XXXX, but have been unable to receive any satisfactory response or concrete information about my order status.

I request immediate attention to this matter with the following actions:
1. Expedite the delivery of my laptop within the next 48 hours
2. Provide tracking information via email and SMS
3. Offer a reasonable compensation for the delay and inconvenience caused

If I do not receive the laptop or a satisfactory response by January 5, 2025, I will be compelled to escalate this matter to the consumer forum and seek a full refund.

I look forward to your prompt resolution of this issue.

Sincerely,
