Subject: Complaint Regarding Incomplete Delivery of Compass Boxes

Dear Sir/Madam,

Reference: Purchase Order No. SR/CB/2024/78 dated January 15, 2024

I am writing to express my dissatisfaction regarding the recent delivery of compass boxes ordered by me on January 15, 2024.

As per my purchase order, I had ordered 500 compass boxes, but the consignment delivered on January 30, 2024, contained only 475 boxes, resulting in a shortage of 25 boxes.

This shortage has caused significant inconvenience as these items were urgently required for distribution to students for their upcoming technical drawing examinations.

I request you to expedite the delivery of the remaining 25 compass boxes immediately. Alternatively, please adjust the billing amount accordingly.

I look forward to your prompt action in resolving this matter.

Yours sincerely,

## Question 2(c) [7 marks]

**Answer the following questions.**

1. **How does the poet describe the old habit?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "Where the Mind is without Fear," Tagore describes old habits as "dead habit" which "straitens" (narrows/constrains) freedom of thought and action. He sees outdated customs and traditions as restricting progress and preventing clear, logical thinking needed for a free nation.

2. **Where was the speaker going? What stopped him on the way?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," the speaker was traveling to fulfill obligations ("promises to keep"). The beauty of "woods filling up with snow" stopped him momentarily on his journey, creating a pause between responsibilities.

3. **What did the stranger say to the policeman?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "After Twenty Years," the stranger (Bob) told the policeman (actually Jimmy) that he was waiting for his friend Jimmy Wells with whom he had promised to meet at that spot exactly twenty years ago, and described how successful he had become out West.

4. **Why did the author return to mountains?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "Leopard," the author returned to the mountains to escape the chaos of city life, seek solitude in nature, and observe wildlife in their natural habitat. He was particularly drawn to the peaceful harmony of the mountain environment.

5. **What was there in place of the store at that spot twenty years ago?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "After Twenty Years," there was "Big Joe" Brady's restaurant at that spot twenty years ago, where Bob and Jimmy had their last dinner together before parting ways.

6. **What does the speaker wish to convey through the phrase "fill up with the snow"?**

   **Answer**: 
   The phrase "fill up with snow" conveys the continuous, gentle snowfall creating a sense of completeness, stillness, and transformation of the landscape. It suggests nature's quiet persistence and the gradual covering of all human traces.

7. **How does the poet describe 'heaven of freedom'?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "Where the Mind is Without Fear," Tagore describes his "heaven of freedom" as a place where people hold their heads high with dignity, knowledge flows freely, the world isn't broken by narrow divisions, words come from truth, reason guides action, and thoughts lead to perfection.

**Mnemonic:** "Past Promises, Present Success, Pending Reunion"

## Question 2(c) [7 marks]

**Answer the following questions.**

1. **Who does the poet address as 'thee' and my father?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "Where the Mind is Without Fear," Tagore addresses God as 'thee' and 'my father,' appealing to the divine to guide his country to true freedom. This spiritual invocation shows his belief that achieving his vision requires divine guidance.

2. **What are the sights and sounds that the poet experiences in the woods?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "Stopping by Woods," the poet experiences the visual sight of "woods filling up with snow" and "frozen lake." The sounds include his horse's "harness bells" shaking, "easy wind," and the soft landing of "downy flake" (snowflakes) - creating a contrast between humanity's sounds and nature's quiet.

3. **What kind of man was his friend Jimmy?**

   **Answer**: 
   Jimmy Wells was portrayed as honest, principled, and loyal. He kept his appointment after twenty years, yet chose duty over friendship when faced with Bob's criminal status. His note to Bob showed compassion and personal conflict, revealing his integrity and emotional depth.

4. **What happened when the leopard sensed the author's presence?**

   **Answer**: 
   When the leopard sensed the author's presence in "Leopard," it paused its drinking, looked directly at the author without aggression, and continued its activity, showing mutual acknowledgment and respect. This moment demonstrated the growing trust between human and wild animal.

5. **What kind of characters does the story after twenty years have?**

   **Answer**: 
   "After Twenty Years" features characters who represent opposing life paths: Bob (the criminal who achieved material success through questionable means) and Jimmy (the honest policeman who chose duty and integrity). Their contrast creates the story's moral dilemma and ironic ending.

6. **What according to the speaker will surprise the horse?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "Stopping by Woods," the speaker suggests the horse would be surprised by stopping "without a farmhouse near" in the dark woods. This unusual pause without practical purpose highlights the contrast between animal practicality and human appreciation for beauty.

7. **What is the poet's opinion about the work, idleness, reason and old customs?**

   **Answer**: 
   In "Where the Mind is Without Fear," Tagore advocates for purposeful work over idleness, valuing reason over blind following of outdated customs. He believes clear reason should guide actions, not "dead habit," and that meaningful work leads to progress toward perfection.
