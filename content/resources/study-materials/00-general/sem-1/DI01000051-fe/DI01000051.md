Semester:                         1st

Category of the Course:           PCC

Prerequisite: Basic of power supply & electronics components

Rationale:      The engineering diploma holders are required to use and maintain various types of
electronically controlled equipment. The fundamental principles of electronics are
to be applied in most of the situations to arrive at the probable solutions which is
faced in the world of work, therefore the knowledge of the functions of various
basic electronic devices and components and practical skills acquired through the
laboratory experiments will help them, when they work with electronic equipment
and its sub-circuits. This course is designed to develop the skills to use the basics
electronic components and apply the knowledge to maintain the various types of
electronic circuits.

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

Note:
- More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to
develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a
suggestive list.
ii. Care must be taken in assigning and assessing study report as it is a first year study report.
Study report, data collection and analysis report must be assigned in a group. Teacher has to
discuss about type of data (which and why) before group start their market survey. The
following are some sample ‘Process’ and ‘Product’ related skills (more may be added/deleted
depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises of this course
required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-
based (group of 3 to5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the
group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-
based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an

       integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of
       individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission.
       The duration of the microproject should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement
       hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to
       develop the industry- oriented COs. A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match
       the competency and the COs.
       Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Diode: Build a circuit on general purpose PCB or breadboard to obtain +12V unregulated DC
       powersupply using full wave bridge rectifier and filter (Duration: 8- 10 hours)
- Photodiode: Build a interruption detector circuit to blink an LED using LDR, and prepare a mini
       projectreport. ((Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Transistor Amplifier: a common emitter amplifier using transistor and prepare a mini project
       report.(Duration: 6-8 hours)
- Transistor Application: Build a transistorized water level indicator and prepare a mini project
- Special Purpose Diodes: Build basic applications using any one or combination of special
       purposediodes , and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- 555 Timer: Build a circuit on a breadboad using 555 timer to generator square with variable duty
       cycleand frequency. ( Duration: 6-8 hours)

     Suggested Activities for Students:
- Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-
     curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
     this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages
     for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio
     which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- Prepare a table and interpret the technical specification of various diodes and transistors using data sheet.
- Prepare specifications of some electronic components.
- Collect information and seminar on any relevant topic related with the course.
- Undertake a market survey of different semiconductor components.
- Identify various types of transistor
- Analysis of 555 Times circuits
