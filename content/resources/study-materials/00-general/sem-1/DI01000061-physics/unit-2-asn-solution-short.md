# Unit-2. Electrostatics - Short Solutions

## Part A: Definitions (1-2 marks)

### Electric Field (E)

Force per unit positive charge at a point.

```
E = F/q₀ = kQ/r²
Unit: N/C or V/m
```

### Electric Potential (V)

Work done to bring unit positive charge from infinity to a point.

```
V = W/q = kQ/r
Unit: Volt (V) or J/C
```

### Electric Potential Difference (ΔV)

Work done to move unit charge from one point to another.

```
ΔV = W/q = V₂ - V₁
Unit: Volt (V)
```

### Electric Flux (Φ)

Number of electric field lines passing through a surface.

```
Φ = E·A = EA cos θ
Unit: N·m²/C or V·m
```

### Capacitor

Device that stores electric charge and energy. Two conducting plates separated by dielectric.

### Capacitance (C)

Ability to store charge. Ratio of charge to potential difference.

```
C = Q/V
C (parallel plate) = ε₀εᵣA/d
Unit: Farad (F)
```

## Part B: Detailed Answers (2-3 marks)

### (1) Coulomb's Law

Electric force between two stationary point charges is directly proportional to product of charges and inversely proportional to square of distance.

```
F = kq₁q₂/r²
k = 9×10⁹ N·m²/C²
```

**Nature:**

- Like charges: Repulsive
- Unlike charges: Attractive

### (2) Characteristics of Electric Field Lines

1. **Start/End:** Start from +ve, end at -ve charges
2. **Direction:** Tangent shows field direction
3. **No intersection:** Lines never cross
4. **Density:** Close lines = strong field, far lines = weak field
5. **Uniform field:** Parallel and equidistant
6. **Imaginary:** Lines are imaginary, field is real
7. **Perpendicular:** Always perpendicular to conductor surface
8. **Open curves:** Never form closed loops

### (3) Parallel Plate Capacitor

**Construction:** Two parallel conducting plates of area A separated by distance d with dielectric between.

**Capacitance:**

```
C = ε₀εᵣA/d = ε₀KA/d
```

**Factors affecting C:**

- C ∝ A (area)
- C ∝ 1/d (distance)
- C ∝ K (dielectric constant)

**Applications:** Energy storage, filtering, timing circuits, coupling/decoupling

### (4) Series Connection of Capacitors

**Characteristics:**

- Same charge: Q₁ = Q₂ = Q₃ = Q
- Different voltages: V = V₁ + V₂ + V₃

**Formula:**

```
1/Cₛ = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃

For 2 capacitors: Cₛ = C₁C₂/(C₁+C₂)
For n equal: Cₛ = C/n
```

**Result:** Cₛ < smallest capacitance

### (5) Parallel Connection of Capacitors

**Characteristics:**

- Same voltage: V₁ = V₂ = V₃ = V
- Different charges: Q = Q₁ + Q₂ + Q₃

**Formula:**

```
Cₚ = C₁ + C₂ + C₃

For n equal: Cₚ = nC
```

**Result:** Cₚ > largest capacitance

### (6) Effect of Dielectric on Capacitance

When dielectric (K) inserted between plates:

**Capacitance increases:**

```
C = KC₀
```

**Why it increases:**

- Dielectric molecules polarize
- Reduces electric field: E = E₀/K
- Reduces voltage: V = V₀/K
- Same charge, lower voltage → higher capacitance

**Other effects:**

- Increases breakdown voltage
- Provides mechanical support
- Makes capacitor compact

C₁₂ = C₁ + C₂ = 10 + 20 = 30 μF
```

**Step 2:** Series with C₃

```
1/Cₜ = 1/30 + 1/30 = 2/30
Cₜ = 15 μF
```

**Answer: 15 μF**
