# Unit-4. LASER and Fiber Optics - Short Solutions

## Part A: Short Answers (1-2 marks)

### (1) Snell's law

The ratio of sine of angle of incidence to sine of angle of refraction is constant.

```
n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂  or  sin i/sin r = n₂/n₁
```

### (2) Full form of LASER

**L**ight **A**mplification by **S**timulated **E**mission of **R**adiation

### (3) Monochromatic and Polychromatic light

- **Monochromatic:** Single wavelength/color (e.g., laser, sodium lamp)
- **Polychromatic:** Multiple wavelengths/colors (e.g., white light, sunlight)

### (4) Properties of laser light

1. Monochromatic (single wavelength)
2. Coherent (waves in phase)
3. Directional (highly focused beam)
4. High intensity
5. Polarized

### (5) Definitions

**Absolute Refractive Index:** Ratio of speed of light in vacuum to speed in medium.

```
n = c/v
```

**Critical Angle:** Angle of incidence in denser medium for which angle of refraction becomes 90°.

```
sin θc = n₂/n₁
```

## Part B: Detailed Answers (2-3 marks)

### (1) Refraction of light

Change in direction of light when passing from one medium to another due to change in velocity.

- Rarer to denser: bends towards normal
- Denser to rarer: bends away from normal

### (2) Refractive index

Measure of how much light slows in a medium.

**Absolute:** n = c/v (always > 1)

Examples: Water (1.33), Glass (1.5), Diamond (2.42)

### (3) Total Internal Reflection (TIR)

Complete reflection of light back into denser medium when traveling from denser to rarer medium.

**Conditions:**

1. Light travels from denser to rarer medium (n₁ > n₂)
2. Angle of incidence > critical angle (i > θc)

**Applications:** Optical fibers, prisms, diamonds, mirages

### (4) Common light vs Laser light

| Property | Common Light | Laser Light |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Wavelength | Multiple | Single |
| Coherence | Non-coherent | Coherent |
| Direction | All directions | Unidirectional |
| Intensity | Low | Very high |
| Source | Spontaneous emission | Stimulated emission |

### (5) Applications of LASER (6 fields)

1. **Medical:** Surgery (LASIK), tumor removal, kidney stones
2. **Communication:** Optical fiber networks, data transmission
3. **Industrial:** Cutting, welding, drilling, 3D printing
4. **Military:** Range finders, guided missiles, LIDAR
5. **Scientific:** Spectroscopy, holography, measurements
6. **Commercial:** Barcode scanners, CD/DVD players, printers

### (6) Types of optical fiber

**By Mode:**

- **Single Mode:** Core 8-10 μm, long distance, low dispersion
- **Multimode:** Core 50-200 μm, short distance, high dispersion

**By Refractive Index:**

- **Step Index:** Uniform core RI, zigzag path
- **Graded Index:** RI decreases from center, sinusoidal path

### (7) Applications of optical fiber

1. **Telecommunications:** Internet, telephone, cable TV
2. **Medical:** Endoscopy, laser surgery, imaging
3. **Industrial:** Sensors, lighting, inspection
4. **Military:** Secure communication, navigation
5. **Networking:** LANs, data centers
6. **Automotive:** Safety systems, entertainment

### (8) Construction of optical fiber

Three layers:

1. **Core:** Glass/plastic, high RI (n₁), carries light (8-200 μm)
2. **Cladding:** Lower RI (n₂), reflects light back (125 μm)
3. **Jacket:** Protective plastic coating (250-900 μm)

Light propagates through TIR at core-cladding interface.

### (9) Advantages of optical fiber over coaxial cable

1. **Higher bandwidth:** Terabits vs Gigabits per second
2. **Lower loss:** 0.2-0.5 dB/km vs 10-30 dB/km
3. **EMI immunity:** Not affected by electromagnetic interference
4. **Higher security:** Difficult to tap
5. **Lighter and smaller:** Easy installation
6. **Non-conductive:** No spark hazard, lightning safe
7. **Longer distance:** 100+ km without repeaters
8. **Corrosion resistant:** Glass/plastic vs metal
9. **Future-proof:** Upgradeable without cable change
10. **Lower cost:** Cheaper raw materials (silica)

## Part C: Numericals (3 marks)

### (1) Refractive index of liquid

**Given:** c = 3×10⁸ m/s, v = 1.8×10⁸ m/s

```
n = c/v = (3×10⁸)/(1.8×10⁸) = 1.67
```

**Answer: 1.67**

### (2) Refractive index of glass

**Given:** c = 3×10⁸ m/s, v = 2×10⁸ m/s

```
n = c/v = (3×10⁸)/(2×10⁸) = 1.5
```

**Answer: 1.5**

### (3) Velocity of light in glass

**Given:** n = 1.56, c = 3×10⁸ m/s

```
v = c/n = (3×10⁸)/1.56 = 1.923×10⁸ m/s
```

**Answer: 1.92×10⁸ m/s**

### (4) Acceptance angle

**Given:** n₁ = 1.563, n₂ = 1.498

```
NA = √(n₁² - n₂²) = √(2.443 - 2.244) = √0.199 = 0.446
θₐ = sin⁻¹(0.446) = 26.5°
```

**Answer: NA = 0.446, θₐ = 26.5°**

### (5) Acceptance angle and NA

**Given:** n₁ = 1.48, n₂ = 1.45

```
NA = √(n₁² - n₂²) = √(2.1904 - 2.1025) = √0.0879 = 0.297
θₐ = sin⁻¹(0.297) = 17.3°
```

**Answer: NA = 0.297, θₐ = 17.3°**
