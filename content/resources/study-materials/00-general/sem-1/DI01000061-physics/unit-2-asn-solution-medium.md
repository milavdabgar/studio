### Electric Potential (V)

**Definition:** Electric potential at a point is the work done in bringing a unit positive charge from infinity to that point against the electric field.

**Formula:**

```
V = W/q = kQ/r
```

**Unit:** Volt (V) = Joule/Coulomb (J/C)

**Key Points:**

- Scalar quantity (no direction)
- Reference point: V = 0 at infinity
- V decreases as distance increases
- V is positive around +ve charge, negative around -ve charge

---

### Electric Potential Difference (ΔV)

**Definition:** Work done in moving a unit positive charge from one point to another in an electric field.

**Formula:**

```
ΔV = V₂ - V₁ = W/q
W = q(V₂ - V₁)
```

**Unit:** Volt (V)

**Physical Meaning:**

- Measures energy required to move charge
- Battery provides potential difference
- Higher ΔV → More energy available

---

### Electric Flux (Φ)

**Definition:** Electric flux through a surface is the total number of electric field lines passing through that surface.

![Electric Flux](unit-2-book-scan_artifacts/image_000015_ea8cf122d11e80250b910248f3f29e6bed211818bf5f4d9ef8da1dddc744d680.png)
*Figure: Electric flux through a surface*

**Formula:**

```
Φ = E · A = EA cos θ
```

Where:

- E = Electric field
- A = Area of surface
- θ = Angle between E and normal to surface

**Unit:** N·m²/C or V·m

**Maximum flux:** When θ = 0° (field perpendicular to surface)
**Zero flux:** When θ = 90° (field parallel to surface)

---

### Capacitor

**Definition:** A device consisting of two conductors (plates) separated by an insulator (dielectric), used to store electric charge and energy.

**Basic Structure:**

- Two parallel conducting plates
- Separated by dielectric material (air, mica, ceramic)
- One plate holds +Q, other holds -Q

**Function:** Stores electrical energy in the electric field between plates

---

### Capacitance (C)

**Definition:** Capacitance is the ability of a conductor or capacitor to store electric charge. It's the ratio of charge stored to potential difference.

**Formula:**

```
C = Q/V

For parallel plate:
C = ε₀εᵣA/d = ε₀KA/d
```

Where:

- ε₀ = 8.85×10⁻¹² F/m (permittivity of free space)
- εᵣ = K = dielectric constant
- A = area of plates
- d = distance between plates

**Unit:** Farad (F)

- 1 Farad = 1 Coulomb/Volt

## Part B: Detailed Answers (2-3 marks)

### (1) State and explain Coulomb's law

**Statement:** The force of attraction or repulsion between two stationary point charges is directly proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.

![Coulomb's Law](unit-2-book-scan_artifacts/image_000002_93bff9bbc0efb7c065572eca4cde6eeac24915da10f24946bda8ea40f0e5f055.png)
*Figure: Force between two point charges*

**Mathematical Form:**

```
F ∝ q₁q₂  and  F ∝ 1/r²

Therefore: F = k(q₁q₂)/r²
```

Where:

- k = 9 × 10⁹ N·m²/C² (Coulomb's constant)
- k = 1/(4πε₀)
- ε₀ = 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F/m

**Vector Form:**

```
F⃗ = k(q₁q₂/r²) r̂
```

**Nature of Force:**

- **Like charges** (both +ve or both -ve): **Repulsive** (push apart)
- **Unlike charges** (+ve and -ve): **Attractive** (pull together)

**Key Points:**

- Valid for point charges or spherical charge distributions
- Force acts along the line joining the charges
- Obeys Newton's third law (action-reaction pair)

### (2) Draw and explain characteristics of electric field lines

**Electric Field Lines:** Imaginary lines whose tangent at any point gives the direction of electric field at that point.

![Field Lines Patterns](unit-2-book-scan_artifacts/image_000011_c74b95eb27cda2adebf9a9ef3e6b8830746f1269312c1d49a4334e230c5a06a1.png)
*Figure: Electric field line patterns for different charge configurations*

**Characteristics:**

1. **Origin and Termination:**
   - Start from positive charges (or infinity)
   - End at negative charges (or infinity)

2. **Direction:**
   - Tangent to field line gives direction of electric field
   - Arrow shows direction of force on +ve test charge

3. **No Intersection:**
   - Two field lines never cross each other
   - If they crossed, field would have two directions at that point (impossible)

4. **Density indicates strength:**
   - Closely spaced lines → Strong field
   - Widely spaced lines → Weak field
   - Number of lines ∝ magnitude of charge

5. **Uniform field:**
   - Parallel and equally spaced lines
   - Example: Between two parallel charged plates

6. **Imaginary nature:**
   - Lines are visualization tool, not physical entities
   - Electric field is real and exists everywhere

7. **Perpendicular to surface:**
   - Field lines always meet conductor surface perpendicularly
   - Tangential component = 0 on conductor surface

8. **Open curves:**
   - Electrostatic field lines never form closed loops
   - They have definite starting and ending points

*Figure: Structure of parallel plate capacitor*

- Two parallel conducting plates of equal area A
- Separated by distance d
- Dielectric material (air, mica, ceramic) between plates
- One plate connected to +ve terminal (charge +Q)

Where:
ε₀ = 8.85×10⁻¹² F/m
εᵣ = K = relative permittivity (dielectric constant)
A = area of plates (m²)
d = separation between plates (m)
```

   - C ∝ 1/d
   - Smaller distance → Stronger field → Higher capacitance

3. **Dielectric constant (K):**
   - C ∝ K
   - Higher K → More capacitance
   - Air: K=1, Mica: K≈6, Ceramic: K≈1000

4. **Permittivity of free space (ε₀):**
   - Fundamental constant = 8.85×10⁻¹² F/m

**Applications:**

**Configuration:** Capacitors connected end-to-end (negative of one to positive of next)

![Series Capacitors](unit-2-book-scan_artifacts/image_000011_c74b95eb27cda2adebf9a9ef3e6b8830746f1269312c1d49a4334e230c5a06a1.png)
*Figure: Capacitors in series connection*

**Characteristics:**

1. **Same charge on all capacitors:**

   ```
   Q₁ = Q₂ = Q₃ = Q (constant)
   ```

2. **Voltage divides:**

   ```
   V = V₁ + V₂ + V₃
   ```

3. **Individual voltages:**

   ```
   V₁ = Q/C₁,  V₂ = Q/C₂,  V₃ = Q/C₃
   ```

**Derivation:**

```
V = V₁ + V₂ + V₃
Q/Cₛ = Q/C₁ + Q/C₂ + Q/C₃

Dividing by Q:
1/Cₛ = 1/C₁ + 1/C₂ + 1/C₃
```

**Special Cases:**

```
Two capacitors: Cₛ = (C₁C₂)/(C₁+C₂)

n equal capacitors: Cₛ = C/n
```

**Key Point:** Equivalent capacitance is **less than smallest** individual capacitance

**Application:** To reduce effective capacitance and increase voltage rating

---

### (5) Parallel combination of capacitors

**Configuration:** All capacitors connected to same two points (all +ve terminals together, all -ve terminals together)

![Parallel Capacitors](unit-2-book-scan_artifacts/image_000011_c74b95eb27cda2adebf9a9ef3e6b8830746f1269312c1d49a4334e230c5a06a1.png)
*Figure: Capacitors in parallel connection*

**Characteristics:**

1. **Same voltage across all capacitors:**

   ```
   V₁ = V₂ = V₃ = V (constant)
   ```

2. **Charge divides:**

   ```
   Q = Q₁ + Q₂ + Q₃
   ```

3. **Individual charges:**

   ```
   Q₁ = C₁V,  Q₂ = C₂V,  Q₃ = C₃V
   ```

**Derivation:**

```
Q = Q₁ + Q₂ + Q₃
CₚV = C₁V + C₂V + C₃V

Dividing by V:
Cₚ = C₁ + C₂ + C₃
```

**Special Case:**

```
n equal capacitors: Cₚ = nC
```

**Key Point:** Equivalent capacitance is **greater than largest** individual capacitance

**Application:** To increase effective capacitance and charge storage

### (6) Effect of dielectric on capacitance of capacitor

**Dielectric:** Insulating material (glass, mica, ceramic, paper) placed between capacitor plates

![Dielectric Effect](unit-2-book-scan_artifacts/image_000015_ea8cf122d11e80250b910248f3f29e6bed211818bf5f4d9ef8da1dddc744d680.png)
*Figure: Effect of dielectric on capacitor*

**Effect: Capacitance Increases**

```
C = KC₀

Where:
C₀ = capacitance with air/vacuum
K = dielectric constant (εᵣ)
K > 1 for all materials
```

**Why Capacitance Increases:**

1. **Polarization:** Dielectric molecules align with electric field
   - +ve ends toward -ve plate
   - -ve ends toward +ve plate

2. **Reduced field:** Internal field opposes applied field

   ```
   E = E₀/K
   ```

3. **Reduced voltage:** For same charge Q

   ```
   V = V₀/K
   ```

4. **Increased capacitance:** C = Q/V

   ```
   C = Q/(V₀/K) = K(Q/V₀) = KC₀
   ```

**Other Effects:**

1. **Increases breakdown voltage:** Can apply higher voltage without sparking
2. **Mechanical support:** Keeps plates separated uniformly
3. **Compact design:** Higher C in smaller size

**Common Dielectrics:**

| Material | K (Dielectric Constant) |
|----------|------------------------|
| Vacuum | 1.0000 |
| Air | 1.0006 |
| Paper | 3.7 |
| Glass | 5-10 |
| Mica | 6 |
| Ceramic | 100-1000 |

```

**Calculation:**

```
C = (8.85×10⁻¹²) × (10⁻⁵) / (10⁻³)

C = 8.85×10⁻¹⁷ / 10⁻³

C = 8.85×10⁻¹⁴ F = 0.0885 pF
```

**Answer: C = 8.85 × 10⁻¹⁴ F (or 0.0885 pF)**

**Note:** Very small capacitance due to small area!

### (6) Area required for 1 Farad capacitor

**Given:**

- C = 1 F
- d = 1 mm = 10⁻³ m
- ε₀ = 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F/m

**Formula:**

```
C = ε₀A/d  →  A = Cd/ε₀
```

**Calculation:**

```
A = (1) × (10⁻³) / (8.85×10⁻¹²)

A = 10⁻³ / 8.85×10⁻¹²

A = 1.13 × 10⁸ m²
```

**Converting to km²:**

```
A = 1.13 × 10⁸ m² = 113 km²
```

**Answer: A = 1.13 × 10⁸ m² (113 km²)**

**Interpretation:** This shows 1 Farad is an enormous capacitance! That's why we use μF, nF, pF in practice. Area needed is larger than a small city!

- C₃ = 30 μF
- Configuration: (C₁ ∥ C₂) in series with C₃

**Step 1: Parallel combination of C₁ and C₂**

```
C₁₂ = C₁ + C₂ = 10 + 20 = 30 μF
```

**Step 2: Series combination with C₃**

```
1/Cₜ = 1/C₁₂ + 1/C₃

1/Cₜ = 1/30 + 1/30 = 2/30

Cₜ = 30/2 = 15 μF
```

**Answer: Total capacitance = 15 μF**

**Alternative method (for two equal capacitors in series):**

```
Cₜ = (C₁₂ × C₃)/(C₁₂ + C₃) = (30 × 30)/(30 + 30) = 900/60 = 15 μF
```
