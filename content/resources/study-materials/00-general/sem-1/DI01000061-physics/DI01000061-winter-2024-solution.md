**In an experiment of finding the periodic time of a simple pendulum, the observations are 1.96 s, 1.98 s, 2.00 s, 2.02 s, 2.04 s. Calculate absolute error, mean absolute error, relative error and percentage error.**

**Answer**:

```
Observations: 1.96, 1.98, 2.00, 2.02, 2.04 s

Mean value = (1.96 + 1.98 + 2.00 + 2.02 + 2.04) ÷ 5 = 2.00 s

Absolute errors: |xi - mean|
|1.96 - 2.00| = 0.04 s
|1.98 - 2.00| = 0.02 s
|2.00 - 2.00| = 0.00 s
|2.02 - 2.00| = 0.02 s
|2.04 - 2.00| = 0.04 s

Mean absolute error = (0.04 + 0.02 + 0.00 + 0.02 + 0.04) ÷ 5 = 0.024 s

Relative error = Mean absolute error ÷ Mean value = 0.024 ÷ 2.00 = 0.012

Percentage error = Relative error × 100 = 0.012 × 100 = 1.2%
```

**Results**: Mean absolute error = 0.024 s, Relative error = 0.012, Percentage error = 1.2%

**Derivation**:

- **Same charge** Q flows through each capacitor
- **Voltage divides**: V = V₁ + V₂ + V₃
