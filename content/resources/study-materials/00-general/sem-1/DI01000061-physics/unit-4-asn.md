## Unit-4. LASER and Fiber Optics (CO-4)

## Part A: Give answers in short. (1 or 2 marks)

- (1) Write Snell's law.

- (2) Write full form of LASER.

- (3) What is monochromatic light and polychromatic light?

- (4) Write properties of laser light.

- (5) Define: Absolute refractive index, Critical angle.

## Part B: Write answers in Detail. (2 or 3 marks)

- (1) Explain refraction of light with figure and examples.

- (2) Explain refractive index. What is absolute refractive index?

- (3) Explain total internal reflection in detail with figure.

- (4) Give difference between common light and laser light.

- (5) Write at least 6 application of laser light in various fields in detail.

- (6) Describe types of optical fiber in detail.

- (7) Write applications of optical fiber in various fields in detail.

- (8) Explain construction of optical fiber with figure.

- (9) Describe advantages of optical fiber over coaxial cable.

## Part C: Numericals (3 marks)

- (1) Velocity of light in air is 3 × 10 8 m/s and in liquid 1.8 × 10 8 m/s, so find out refractive index of liquid.

- (2) Velocity of light in air is 3 × 10 8 m/s and in glass 2 × 10 10 m/s, so find out refractive index of glass.

- (3) light enters in glass medium from air. Glass has refractive index is 1.56. So find velocity of light in glass.

- (4) one optical fiber has value of refractive indices are 1.563 and 1.498, respectively. Calculate acceptance angle of optical fiber.

- (5) An optical fiber has value of refractive indices are 1.48 and 1.45, respectively. Calculate acceptance angle and numerical aperture of optical fiber.
