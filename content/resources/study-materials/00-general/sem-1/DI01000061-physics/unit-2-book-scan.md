## 2.1 Introduction:

proportional to the squareofthe distance betweenthem,

The importanceofoxygen to the body is the sameas heimportance of electric powerto technology. Electricityis called the "Mother of Technology",where isthe foundation ofelectricity. The most important property felectric charge is that it can betransferred from one object to another. You know that when twosuitable objects are rubbed against each other, electric charge is transferred on both of them. For example, aglassrod becomes positively charged by losing electrons when it isrubbedwith silk, thesilkbecomes negatively chargedby getting electrons this case.

While wearingortaking offashirt, t-shirt or sweater1 in adry environment (mostlyin winter) you mighthaveheard a cracking sound with/without a spark.

Sparkling sparkswith acrackling soundis experienced whilecovering awoolen blanket on awinter night. Everybody has experienced unnoticingfelt a shock while holding metal handle ofthe door ofthe house,openingthe doorof the car or holding the metalrod in the bus. Lightning flashes in the skywith the thunder of the clouds. All these happen because oftransfer ofelectricity due to anyreason anyhow. Here the electric charge that is fixed on the object is called staticcharges and the study oftheir effects is called static

"Electric Charge"1 cm apart, they exert a gravitationalforce of 5.5 x1067 N force called electric force of Fe =2.24 x 10*N exists oneach other. However,at thesame distance, a repulsive than the gravitational force. Thus,electric force is very between two electrons. Electricforce is 10S times greater strong. Even whentwo protons are placed at a distance of while|(apart ftromeach other) I cm,anelectricrepulsive force of inan equal value exists. However, the electric force of attraction betweenaproton and an electron at a distance of cm seems to be of equalvalue. Thus just as mass is the main cause of gravitationalforce, the property of particies due to which an electricforce exists between them is called the electric charge' oftheparticle. The force acting between two like charges is repulsive and it is attractive betweentwo, theunlike charges. From the abovediscussion, it isclear that the magnitude of thecharge onanelectron andaproton is the same but they are of the opposite type. Conventionally charge of an electron is considered negative and that of a proton is positive. However, if thesign convention of electronic charge (onproton andelectron) is changed, it makes no difference whatsoever to the field of scienceand technology!! And, the value ofthis charge ise= 1.6x 10-19 C.TheSIunit of electric charge is coulomb, abbreviated asC.

Only electrons aretransferred during any chemical process orwhen acharge is transferred. Thus,the substance whichreceives electrons becomes negatively charged and the substance which loses electrons becomes positively In general, every object is neutral.

## 2.2.1 Quantization of Electric Charge :

Experiments show that the magnitudeofan electric charge is always an integer multiple of thefundamental charge (charge eof an electron or proton). The unit of charge is Coulomb. .Thus,

2.2 You know that every substance is made up ofatoms Or molecules. Each atom is made up of electrons moving in xed orbits around its nucleus. There are positively charged protons andIneutral neutrons inside the nucleus. Thus, every substance is made up of electrons, protons and neutrons, Called Fundamental Particles, Here,the mass of an electron S M =9.lx 10-31 kg,themass of a proton and aneutron are considØred I to be nearly the same, i.e. M, GLYPH&lt;26&gt; M,1.6 x 10-27 kg. gravitation

This is known as thequantization of electric charge. The value of the basic unit of chargeorelementary charge is

## e=1.6x 10-19 coulomb

Ifa body contains n, electrons andn,protons, the total amountofcharge on the body is q= n,(e) +t n(-e) =(n,-n)e

called the conversation of charges For example, byn |aglass rod with apiece ofsilk cloth (thesetwo objects basically neutral sotheir total charge is zero), the e glassn becomes positively charged andthe silk cloth becom negatively charged. Thus, thetotal sum of the clect chargeson them remains zero.Inother words,only th processes arepossible, in an isolated system, inwhich clectric chargeis conserved.

## 2.2.3 Charging- by FrictionorInduction :

Asny,ny? are integers,their difference must also bean integer.Thus,the charge on anybody is alwaysan integral multiple of e, and can beincreased or decreased also in stens ofe. As

Thus, any charged body or charged particle can possess charge equal to - 1e, t2e, +3eand so on.

=t2x1.6 x 1019C=t 3.2x x 10-19 C

q =+3e =t3x

Aswe havejustseen,rubbingtheglassrod withasik cloth, both areelectricaly charged; glass rod is positively charged and silk cloth is negatively charged. The charging means generating (placing) electricity onany object. Takea comb and apply it to dryhair. Whena comb is applied to dry hair and then kept closer to a tiny piece of paper, it will attract thepaper. This is so because the piece of paperand the comb both possess oppositekinds of electric charges. 10CThus,an electric charge can be generatedby rubbingan 101C| object andthe object can be charged.

1.6 x 101C=t4.8 x andsoon.Thevalues ofcharge lying in between these values are not possible.

Thecauseof quantization is that only integral number ofelectrons canbe transferred from one body to another, on ubbing. For example, when one electron is transterred, the| (suchas clothes, grain, oil, etc.) and charges acquired bythetwo bodies will be q =le=+1.6 x 10-19 C. Similarly, when n electrons are transferred, the charge acquired by the two bodies will be q =tne=tnx 1.6 x 10-19 C.

## 2.2.2 Conservationof Electric Charge :

enter from outside nor escape from inside is called an The system in which an electric charge can neither electrically isolated system, The algebraic sum of the electric charges (total electric charge) in an electrically isolated system always remains constant, irespective that takes place in the system. For example,let a systemof zero total charge. Suddenly, a positive charge is generated in this system. Since the algebraic sum of chargeis to be constant (here, zero), the charge before and after the process should Iremain the same. When a positive charge issphere loses generated in a process, a negative charge should also be generated inthe process, sothat the total charge zero. Thus, this rule of keeping thetotal charge constant is generate directly into the ground. There is another wayto charge an object other th friction and thatis induction. Suppose a metal sphere somehow positively charged (+0) and placed on an insulatin of any processstand. When the similar but the electrically neutral sphere is madeto touch the first sphere or both spheres are metal connected with a conducting wire, the positive charge of the first sphere is equalized by the electrons on the second sphere. Since both the spheres are identical, the second Q/2 negative charge and becomes positively charged. The chargeon thefirst sphere is also Q/2 remainsQ2. Thus, a neutral sphereis also electrically charged when it comesin contact witha charged sphere.

Similarly, the friction between the metallic body of a moving truck and the atmosphericair causesthe body tobe charged. Thiselectric chargecan also spark, whichcan be very dangerous forits petrol tank, to the combustiblegoods other vehicles running around such as petrol tankers.So often a chain of iron attached to the body of the truck is kept slidingon theroad so that the electric charge generated/accumulated I on the vehicle body passes to the ground. The vehicle tiresare made by adding carbontothe rubberso that the electricity flows

anddeduced that "Theelectric force (Couloumbianforce) between twostationary pointcharges is directly proportional When this rod is kept closer to to the product oftheir charges andinversely proportionalto the square ofthe distancebetween them."This is Coulomb's | law. This force is along the line ofjoining the two charges.

Let two stationary point charges q and q2 are separated bya distance r. The coulombianelectricforce between them,

When there is vacuum or air medium between the charges,the electric force constant orcoulomb'sconstant k= 8.9875x10 9x 10° Nm†c2 in SIsystem. In CGSs system, k=l dyne cmC2.

An electrically neutral metal sphere is placed onthe insulating stand (Figure-2.1). A glass rod is positively charged bynubbing with silk. the sphere, electrons ofthe sphereare attracted towards the part of the surface where the positively charged glass rod is kept closer. The positive charge isexposed on the back surface of the sphere. As soon as the rear surface ofthe sphere is grounded with conducting wire, the electrons from the ground rush to the surface of the sphere and the positive charge become electricaly neutral onreceivingtheseelectrons. The negativecharge stillremains on the surface towards the rod (Fig -2.lc and d). Now removing the rod from the phere, the remaining negative charge onthe sphere is evenly distributed over thesphere (Fig 2.1-e). Thus,the sphere can De charged without bringing into direct contact with the Charged glass rod. This method is called "Induction".

Here, it is interesting thatthe glass rod does not lose any electric charge and the sphere gets charged. Whileinthe direct contactmethod, discussed above, the second sphere receives the same charge as thecharged sphere loses. This is the main differencebetween charging an object using the method.

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Coulomb's law can be used to obtain the electric (Coulombian) force acting betweentwo electric charges. But, if more thantwoelectric charges are present, the net electricforceacting on anyoneofthem can be obtained by superposition in addition to Coulomb'slaw. The net electric force between them can be obtained by summing the individual forces exerted between each pair of electric charges. Thisis calledthe superposition principle.

Therefore, the total net force exerted on the tes charge is obtained by summing each of those forces.

## 23 Electric Field:

Coulomb's law determines the electric force acting berween (two electrically) charged objects. However, if the number of fcharged objects s (or electric charges) is large and the charge on eachis different t then this calculation becomes very complex andtedious.

The Sl unit of (intensityof) electric field is newton/coulomb NC), The calculation of the force betweenelectric charges has become quite easydue to electricfield concept. experience ,

## 23.1Electric Field (Intensity) of a PointCharge :

As shown in Figure2.3, let a point electriccharge Q be placed at the origin Oofthe axes.Now a positive test |to measure theelectric Charge t gois placed at the point P at a distance rin the40 Vicnity of ChargeO will exert a repulsive forceon it in the drecion of O to P.Position of)should not be changed due to g, Test charge experiences an electricforcethat depends only uponthe electric field (intensity) ofQatthe rdistance vay from it. The test charge ga, is very small (40-GLYPH&lt;26&gt;0), otherwise electric field of o may react with that of Q. Therefore we cannot findlelectric field of charge Q. Also note that qo cannot be less than theelementary charge ofan electron (orproton) (=1.6x 1019 C). Thus, by placing a positive charge 9% at point P at a distancer from 0, it EGLYPH&lt;26&gt;periences an electric force in the electric field ofQ. This is simply y called the electric field of Q.

It was Faraday who first conceptualized the electric field. The charge (or a set of charges) that produces an electric field is calledthe source charge andthe charge used field is called thetestcharge. Taking =1C in equation (10), E =F occurs. From this. the electric field can be defined as follows.

force is in the direction of E,andso on. In fact,when a positive charge is released intoanelectric field, the electric field line indicates the direction in which it moves under electric force:Thus, an electric field line isa curve drawnin an electric field, in suchaway thatthe tangent to the curve at any point is in the direction ofthe net electric field at that point.

## Characteristics ofElectric Field Lines :

1. Electic field lines start frompositivecharges and end at negative charges. 1 .
2. GLYPH&lt;26&gt;. Thetangent drawn at any point on the electric field lines indicates the direction of theelectric field at that point.
3. Two electtic field linesnever cross (intersect) cach other. As shown in Figure-2.7, if two electric field lines intersecteach other at any point,then tg charge at thatpoint experiences

the force in both E, and E, directions,which is not possible.i.e. at the intersection point of two electric field lines, two tangents can be drawnwhich indicate twodirectionsofelectric field and this is impossible.

Aswehave discussed earlier, the number of ele field lines passing through a given area determines whet the intensity theelectric field in that area is high or low concept of electric flux is based on the same princip Figure 2.9 showsthe electric field lines andthe difh surfaces (whose surface area is A).

So the number offield lines having: area A is equal to EA. 7

7. Electric Field lines are always perpendicular to the conducting surface-inboth cases,leavingthe electric charge orentering the electric charge. This is the reason why the electric field in the direction parallel to the conducting surface is zero.That is, electric forcedoes not exist paralel to the conducting surface.

Similarly, the e angle between thedirection perpendicular to S, and E is = 0o so the electric fluxX associated with S, is,

This is denoted by Equation(13). Thus,placing any surface in an electric field,if the angle between the normal to the s surface andthe electric fieldis 0, then the flux(ie.the number of suspended electric lines from that surface) nGLYPH&lt;26&gt;ated with that surface , can be equated to EA cos AElectrical flux is a scalar quantity and its SIunit is V,,or NmC.

If the flux associated with asurface is zeromeans the number of electric field lines passing through thatsurface is GLYPH&lt;26&gt;r0..e. the electric field line does not pass through that surface.

When a rectangular wire-frameis kept slanting in the water flow,the water flowing through it is less than the same frame is kept perpendicular in the water flow. Because when the frame is kept parallel to the water flow, no water passes through it. Similarly, when a paper-fan is kept perpendicular to (in front of flowing) wind/air flow, it rotates fast. When it is tilted it slowed down, and when it is in the direction ofthe wind, it almost stops rotating. Thus, the conceptofflux is very useful for understanding many lawsandtheir applications in electronics.

OA = rA, OB = and AB =r. The work done upon a unitpositive charge to move it from point A to point B is the product offorce and displacement.

## 2.5 Capacitor and Capacitance: 1.5.1 Introduction to Capacitors:

capacitor is a simple device that stores electric charge and electric energy. Capacitors are used tostore more electrical charges or electrical energy in less space.A capacitor is usually r made by placing a dieelectric medium between twoconductive plates of the same dimension. A capacitor of the desired capacitance can be made by changing the distance between theplates andits dimensions. Capacitors are an important component in almost all eloctrical, electronicand micro-electronic circuits. Differenconductors, types of capacitors are used inall devices for generating, carrying and storing energy. One or more capacitors are important component in the circuits like Ultrasonic. Microwave, Radio, Laser, etc. for the production, amplification, andtransmission ofsoundor electromagnetic waves. Capacitors are used to tune radio receivers and televisions over the appropriate frequency band. Capacitors are used in almost all decoration and entertainment devices related to soundand light. Capacitors are an important part of alltypes of circuits ofmeasuringinstruments forscientific research and testing. A capacitor Capacitors

## 2.5.2 Capacitance :

As the positive charge (+0)on the surface ofan isolated conductive sphere is gradually increased., the electric| potential (V)ón the surface ofthe sphere andtheelectric field (E)arpund the sphere also goon increasing accordingly. Inthis process,at one stage, the sphere becomes electrically saturated, means the spherecan no longer store more electricity thanits capacity.So;the electric field due to the sphere becomes sufficiently strong that it can ionize the Sumounding air particles that the insulating property ofthe air gets destroyed. Because, at thispoint, an electric charge n addition to its capacity leaks fromthe sphere and causes Ionization (separation of atomic positive andnegative electrie charges) of the surrounding air. Throughout this process, the Tatio (Q/V) )of the electriccharge (Q onthesphere andits Magnitude (V)remains constant. This ratio is called its pacitance (C,Here. conductors of any shapecan be laken insteadof spheres.

conductors when they are placed at a short distanceapart Potential Difference (pd) arises between two from each other and same magnitude(Q coulomb) Opposite charge (one ispositivelycharged and another is negatively charged) is stored upon them. Here,the ratio of electric charge(Qcoulomb) and potential diference (Vvolt) between thetwo identical but oppositelycharged conductive plates kept at a very smalldistance apart is called capacitance of the system made upofthese conductors. The magnitude of capacitance depends on the dimensions of the two their relative arrangenment,the dielectric medium between themandthedistance between the two.

## 2.5.3 Capacitor :

When a positively charged conductor (positive plate) anda negatively charged conductor (negative plate) are separated bya distance less than their dimensions (length and breadth) andadielectric medium is placed between the two,and both conductors are connected to thetwo terminals of the battery, a potential difference(V)is formedbetween the two. This mechanismis calledcapacitor. The charge(O ofa positiveplateis calledthe charge onthe capacitor.(A device formed bytwo conductive plates bearing equal but opposite electric charge; andseparated by a distance less than their dimensions with a dielectric material between them is called capacitor. )

Here, the capacitance of the capacitor,C= Q/V

The Slunit of capacitance is the coulomb/volt called farad(F).Sincefarad (F) is a very largeunit for measuring the capacitÆnce of real capacitors, in practice microfarad (microfaräd; l uF =106 F), nano farad(nanofarad; InF = 10-9 F)andpicofarad (picofarad; IpF=10-12F) are used.

A capacitor is a device designed to store a large amountof electric charge and hence electric energy in asmall space. In general, a system in which the two oppositely charged platesseparated bya dielectric medium is called a capacitor. Mostly, plates of a capacitor are charged by attaching them to different terminals of the battery. The electric charge ontwoplates of a capacitoris usually taken as +Qand -Qwith their electric potentialsare V,and V, respectively. Here, the potential differencebetweenthetwo plates is V=V,-V,andtheelectric chrge of thecapacitor is said to be Q.

The capacitance of a charged conductor can be significantly increased by bringing an uncharged earth-cylindrical connectedconductorcloser to that charged When twoconductive plates are separated by a dielectric medium in thisway is called acapacitor.

Thecapacitors with fixed capacitance are denoted by 7I-symbol while the capacitors with variable capacitance are denotedby symbols.

As an interesting case, a single conducting sphere of radius Randhaving chargeQ with potential difference of V= kQ R can also be consider as a capacitor, because it also has some capacity to store electric charge. Forsuch a capacitor, imagine another sphere at infinite distance having -Qchargewill havezero potential difference (V = 0). The potential difference betweenthe proposed sphereand the imaginary sphereat infinite distance will also be V - kQR. So, the capacitance of the sphere will be,

## 2.5.4 Types ofCapacitors[Only forInformation] :

Thereare different types of capacitorsdepending on| the material used in their fabrication.Suchas:Electrolytic Capacitor, Mica Capacitor, PaperCapacitor, Film Capacito, Non-Polarized Capacitor and Ceramic Capacitor. An Electrolyticcapacitor uses athin metallic film as anodeand apaste ofelectrolyte chemical asacathode, wherethe thin layer of oxide is dielectric.

Let the left side plate ofcapacitor C, is givena +Q charge. Electrostatic induction gives a-Q charge ontheinside and +Q charge on the outside of theright sideplate of capacitor C,. This +Qelectric charge is transmitted to the plate on the left. And this process continues. (In the sameway a negatively charged electron-current flowsinthe opposite direction.) Thus, each capacitor will receive an equal charge of +Qmagnitude. Since the capacitance of each capacitor different, the potential difference with respect to each capacitor is different.If potential difference across C,,Co.Cau V,V,,VGLYPH&lt;26&gt;, ..

In a series or parallel connection capacitor,the electric current is generated only wherethebatteryis connet the capacitor plate. In the rest ofthe plates, only the shifting ofthe charge occurs.

## 2.5.7 Effect of Dielectric Material on the Capacitanceof Parallel Plate Capacitor:

## SUMMARY

- Every substance (atom)is basically made up of electrons,protons and neutrons,calledFundamental Particles.
- The mass of an electron is M,=9.1x 10-31 Kg,the mass ofa proton and a neutron are considered to be nearly the same, i.e. M, M,=1.6x 10-27 kg.
- There are two types of electric charges-Positive and Negative. The force actingbetween two like charges isrepulsiveandit is attractive between unlike charges.
- When two suitable objects are rubbed together, electric charge is transferred to them. For example, while rubbing a glass rod with a silk cloth,the glass rod becomespositively charged by losing electrons and silk becomes negatively charged by getting electrons.
- Thecharge that is fixed on anobject is called static charge and the study oftheir effects is called static electricity.
- Two objectscan becharged byrubbing them together (friction). When an electrically charged object is brought closure to another object, it can be charged byinduction.
- When electric charges are madeto movebyapplying someforce, the movement ofcharges iscalledelectric current and the study of effects produced by an electric current is calledcurrent electricity.
- A repulsive force called electric force of F =2.24 x 10-24 N exists betweentwo electrons.
- Electric force is 105 timesgreaterthan the gravitaio force. The property of particles due to which electric force exists between them is called the elech. charge oftheparticle. A specificproperty of mat due to which a much more powerful force exis between two objects than the gravitational for (1043 times higher) is called electric charge.
- The magnitude of all electric charges found in natur are always in integral multiple of a fundamenti charge. This fundamental charge is e=1.6x 10-9 coloumb (C)that is egqual to the charge on anelectron ora proton. This is calledthe quantisation ofelectri: charge Q =ne.
- The charge of anelectron is e,=-1.6x 10-19Cand the charge of aproton is e, =1.6 x 10-19 C.
- The net electric charge in an isolatedsystem remains the same before and after any reaction or procesS takes place in it. The net electric charge (orthe algebraicsumof charges) in an electrically isolated system remains constant, irrespective ofanyprocesS takes place.This is the quantization ofelectric
- charge. Theelectric force (Coulombian force) betweentwo stationary point charges is directly proportional tothe product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square ofthe distance betweenthem,"This is Coulomb'slaw.This forceisalong theline ofjoining the two charges.
- If 4192&gt;0, repulsive force exists between the two charges andfor g1 92&lt;0, there is an attractive force between the charges.
- The electric(Coulombian) force between two stationary point charges qGLYPH&lt;26&gt;and g,separated by a distance r is 9192 point

- Since the relative permeability ofthe mediun (E,), is always greater than one, the Columbian force (F) in a given medium is less thanthe force'exerted in a vacuum (F). Thus GLYPH&lt;26&gt;, &gt; 1GLYPH&lt;26&gt;F, &lt;F.
- Superposition Principle: The netelectric force between more than two electric charges in space can be obtained by taking the algebraic sum of all the individual forces exerted betweeneach pair ofelectric charges. This is called the superposition principle. (Coulomb's law can be used to obtain the electric (Coulombian) forceacting between two stationary eleGLYPH&lt;26&gt;tric point charges.)

- An electric field of point tq charge is in the radial direction away fromthat electric chargeand,similarly, the electrie field of-q charge is inward in the radial direction. The electric fieldalways exits (starts from) tq and hangs on (endsat) +q.
- Electric field (force) lines start from the positive charge and end on a negative charge. The tangent drawn at any point on the electric field line indicates the direction of the electric field atthat point. Two electric field lines never intersect each other. The distance between the electric field lines indicates the intensity of the electric field in that area. The closely (Densely) arranged electricfield lines indicates a strong(high) electric field (intensity) and vice versa. Spaciously arranged (scattered)electricfield lines indicates weak (poor) electric field (intensity) and vice versa. Field linesofthe homogeneous (uniform) electric field are parallel to each other and at equal distances from each other. Electric field lines are imaginary,but electric field is reality. Electric Field lines are always perpendicular to the conducting surface.
- The electric flux () is the number of electric fieldlines passing perpendicular to a given surfacearea. o= E.A. =EAcos0.Electric flux is a scalar quantity and its SI unit is Vm or Nm†/C.
- Some work is to be done on the electric charge to make it move in the electric field. The work doneon the unit electricchargeto move it in the electric field is called electric potential at that point. The electric potential at distance rfrom thechargeqin its electric field is V=kq/r.

- The potential difference (PD)due to charge (q)GLYPH&lt;26&gt; between two pointsat rdistance is as follows.
- A capacitor is a device designed to store a large amountofelectric chargeand hence electric energy in asmall space.
- Whena positively chargedconductor (positive plate) and a negatively charged conductor (negative plate) are separated by a distance less than their dimensions (length and breadth) andadielectric medium is placed between the two,andboth conductors are connected to the twoterminals of the battery, a potential difference (V)is formed between the two. This mechanismis called capacitor.
- Thecharge (Q) of apositive plate is called the charge onthe capacitor.
- The value of capacitance depends on the dimensions (shape, size andarea) ofthe two conducting plates andthe distance between them. It also depends on the dielectric medium.The distancebetween twoplates in acapacitor is kept very short in comparison to the dimensions (length/ width/radius) of the plates t&lt;A.
- Capacitance(C)= Electric charge (Q)Potential difference (V)
- TheSIunit of capacitance is the coulomb/volt called farad (F). Sincefarad (F)is a very large unit for measuring the capacitance of realcapacitors, in practice microfarad (microfarad; 1 uF = 10-6 F), nanofarad(nanofarad; 1nF = 10-9F) and picofarad (picofarad; I pF =10-12F) are used.
- The capacitors with fixed capacitance are denoted by -||-symbol while the capacitors with variable capacitance are denoted by symbols.
- In aparallel plate capacitor, two parallel conducting plates ofthesame area (A) are separated at very short distance (d) from each other where a dielectric medium (insulating material) is placed betweenthe twoplates.
