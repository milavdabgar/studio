**Academic Year:** 2024
Semester:                         1or 2
Category of the Course:           BSC

Prerequisite:     10+
Rationale:          Physics is branch of science mainly deals with interaction of energy and matter
and considered as the mother of all engineering disciplines. Diploma engineers
(technologists) have to deal with various materials while using/ maintaining
machines. More over the basic knowledge of principles of physics helps diploma
students to lay foundations of core engineering courses. The laws and principles of
physics, formulae and knowledge of physical phenomena and physical properties
provides a means of estimating the behavior of things before we design and observe
them. This course of modern physics has been designed as per program
requirements to help students to study the relevant core engineering courses. The
complicated derivations have been avoided. This course will help the diploma
engineers to use/apply the basic concepts and principles of physics solve well
designed engineering problems and comprehend different technology based
applications.

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:
No                                  Course Outcomes                                 RBT Level
Use relevant instruments with precision to measure the dimension of given R/U/A
physical quantities in various engineering situations.
Apply the concepts of electrostatics and capacitance for engineering R/U/A
applications.
- 3   Use the concept of waves and ultrasonic for various engineering applications.
Use the concepts of LASER and Fiber optics for various engineering R/U/A
- 5   Use the concepts of semiconductor devices for engineering applications.
