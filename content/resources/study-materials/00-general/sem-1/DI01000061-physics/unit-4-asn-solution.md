# Unit-4. LASER and Fiber Optics - Solutions

## Part A: Short Answers (1 or 2 marks)

### (1) Write Snell's law

**Answer:** Snell's law states that when light passes from one medium to another, the ratio of sine of angle of incidence to the sine of angle of refraction is constant and equal to the ratio of refractive indices of the two media.

**Mathematical form:**

```
n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂
```

or

```
sin i / sin r = n₂ / n₁ = constant
```

Where:

- n₁ = refractive index of first medium
- n₂ = refractive index of second medium
- θ₁ (or i) = angle of incidence
- θ₂ (or r) = angle of refraction

### (2) Write full form of LASER

**Answer:** LASER stands for **Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation**.

- **L** - Light
- **A** - Amplification
- **S** - Stimulated
- **E** - Emission
- **R** - Radiation

### (3) What is monochromatic light and polychromatic light?

**Answer:**

**Monochromatic Light:** Light consisting of only one wavelength or single color. It has a single frequency and energy. Example: Laser light, sodium vapor lamp light.

**Polychromatic Light:** Light consisting of multiple wavelengths or many colors. It contains waves of different frequencies. Example: White light, sunlight.

---

### (4) Write properties of laser light

**Answer:** Properties of laser light are:

1. **Monochromaticity** - Single wavelength/color (single frequency light)
2. **Coherence** - All waves are in phase (temporal and spatial coherence)
3. **Directionality** - Highly directional beam, propagates in one specific direction with minimal divergence
4. **High Intensity** - Concentrated energy in a narrow beam, very powerful and bright
5. **Polarization** - Waves vibrate in a single plane
6. **Low Divergence** - Beam remains parallel even after traveling long distances
7. **Focused Beam** - Can be focused to a very small area, depositing energy in a tiny spot
8. **High Speed** - Travels at tremendous velocity (speed of light)

---

### (5) Define: Absolute refractive index, Critical angle

**Answer:**

**Absolute Refractive Index:** The ratio of speed of light in vacuum (or air) to the speed of light in that medium.

```
n = c / v
```

Where:

- n = absolute refractive index
- c = speed of light in vacuum (3 × 10⁸ m/s)
- v = speed of light in the medium

**Critical Angle:** The angle of incidence in the denser medium for which the angle of refraction in the rarer medium becomes 90°. Beyond this angle, total internal reflection occurs.

```
sin θc = n₂ / n₁  (where n₁ > n₂)
```

---

## Part B: Detailed Answers (2 or 3 marks)

### (1) Explain refraction of light with figure and examples

**Answer:**

**Refraction of Light:** The phenomenon of change in direction (bending) of light when it passes from one transparent medium to another is called refraction. This occurs because the speed of light varies in different media.

**Diagram:**

![Refraction through Glass Slab](unit-4-book-scan_artifacts/image_000000_14970c3e348b2ecca5b78372097cf29812965c6414b9609dbff8a1e32ddccda5.png)

**ASCII Representation:**

```
    Air (Rarer Medium - n₁)
         |
      PQ |  ← Normal N₁
    i ↗  |  
   P/___Q|______________ AB (Glass Surface)
     ↘  |
   r  ↘ |  Glass (Denser Medium)
       ↘|  
        R  ← Refracted Ray QR
        |
        |  ← Normal N₂
     e ↗|  
      / |______________ CD (Glass Surface)
     /  |
    S   |  Air (Rarer Medium)
        ↓  Emergent Ray RS
```

**Explanation:**

- When light travels from rarer to denser medium (air to glass), it bends towards the normal (θ₂ < θ₁)
- When light travels from denser to rarer medium (glass to air), it bends away from the normal (θ₂ > θ₁)
- The bending occurs because light travels at different speeds in different media

**Examples:**

1. A pencil partially immersed in water appears bent
2. A coin at the bottom of a water-filled vessel appears raised
3. Twinkling of stars due to atmospheric refraction
4. Formation of mirages in deserts
5. Lenses in spectacles correct vision through refraction

---

### (2) Explain refractive index. What is absolute refractive index?

**Answer:**

**Refractive Index:** It is a measure of how much light slows down when it passes through a medium. It determines the bending of light rays at the interface between two media.

**Types:**

1. **Relative Refractive Index:** The ratio of speed of light in first medium to speed of light in second medium.

   ```
   n₂₁ = v₁ / v₂ = n₂ / n₁
   ```

2. **Absolute Refractive Index:** The ratio of speed of light in vacuum (or air) to the speed of light in that medium.

   ```
   n = c / v
   ```

   Where:
   - c = 3 × 10⁸ m/s (speed of light in vacuum)
   - v = speed of light in the medium

**Properties:**

- Always greater than 1 for any medium (except vacuum where n = 1)
- Higher refractive index means light travels slower in that medium
- Depends on wavelength of light (causes dispersion)

**Refractive Indices of Common Materials (at 20°C):**

| Medium | Refractive Index |
|--------|------------------|
| Vacuum/Air | 1.000 |
| Ice (0°C) | 1.31 |
| Water | 1.333 |
| Ethyl Alcohol | 1.362 |
| Glycerine | 1.473 |
| Glass/Benzene | 1.501 |
| Quartz | 1.554 |
| Polystyrene | 1.595 |
| Diamond | 2.417 |

**Key Points:**

- Optically denser medium has higher refractive index
- Optically rarer medium has lower refractive index
- Higher n means light travels slower in that medium

---

### (3) Explain total internal reflection in detail with figure

**Answer:**

**Total Internal Reflection (TIR):** When light traveling from a denser medium to a rarer medium is completely reflected back into the denser medium at the interface, the phenomenon is called total internal reflection.

**Conditions for TIR:**

1. Light must travel from denser to rarer medium (n₁ > n₂)
2. Angle of incidence must be greater than critical angle (i > θc)

**Diagram from Textbook:**

![Total Internal Reflection](unit-4-book-scan_artifacts/image_000001_76b4f6c445184617690172eaf4b98d3d4a0759f39efc5cbf3f63e2f62f8a388c.png)

     (Reflected)  (Totally Reflected)|
                                    |
```

**Explanation:**

- Ray A: i < θc → Refraction occurs (bends away from normal)
- Ray B: i = θc → Refracted ray grazes along the surface (r = 90°)
- Ray C: i > θc → Total internal reflection occurs

**Critical Angle Formula:**

```
sin θc = n₂ / n₁  (where n₁ > n₂)

or

θc = sin⁻¹(n₂ / n₁)
```

**Examples of Critical Angles:**

1. **Glass-Air Interface:**
   - n₁ (glass) = 1.50, n₂ (air) = 1.00
   - θc = sin⁻¹(1.00/1.50) = sin⁻¹(0.667) = **41.1°**

2. **Water-Air Interface:**
   - n₁ (water) = 1.33, n₂ (air) = 1.00
   - θc = sin⁻¹(1.00/1.33) = sin⁻¹(0.752) = **48.75°**

3. **Diamond-Air Interface:**
   - n₁ (diamond) = 2.42, n₂ (air) = 1.00
   - θc = sin⁻¹(1.00/2.42) = sin⁻¹(0.413) = **24.4°**
   - This small critical angle explains diamond's brilliant sparkle

**Applications:**

1. Optical fibers for data transmission
2. Prisms in periscopes and binoculars
3. Brilliance of diamonds (due to very small critical angle)
4. Mirage formation in deserts
5. Endoscopy in medical field
6. Sparkling of crystal glass

**Key Points:**

- Core has higher refractive index than cladding (n₁ > n₂)
- Light is confined to core by total internal reflection
- Typical core/cladding ratio determines fiber characteristics
- Multiple fibers bundled together form fiber optic cables
- The difference in refractive indices (Δn = n₁ - n₂) is small (~0.01-0.02)
- **Acceptance Angle (θₐ):** Maximum angle at which light can enter the fiber and still propagate via TIR
- **Numerical Aperture (NA):** sin θₐ = √(n₁² - n₂²) - measures light-gathering capacity
- Larger NA means better light-gathering ability
- Typical NA values range from 0.13 to 0.50
