## 4.1 Refraction, Refractive Index and Snell's law

As long as a ray oflight ttravelsina single medium, its |ncident irection does I not change. That is, it moves ina straight line. ray Buhen aray oflight passes fromonetransparent medium nnother transparent medium, its velocity changes. When elicht ray enters obliquely fromonetransparent medium to mother transparentmedium, it deviates from the original irection at the surface separating the two media.This D ahenomenon is called refraction.

## 4.1.1 Refraction

As we know, the speed oflight varies in different nediums. Optically rarer media,such as vacuum orair, have higher velocity, while other denser transparent mediahave lower velocity., Hencethe phenomenon of refraction occurs when aray of light travels fromonemedium to another.The Tay refracted light is called a refracted ray.

In the previous standards, you have studied the Eracion oflight bythe experiment with a transparentglass-|the UbOid). Without repeating thatexperiment, let us once Jaln understand the samephenomenon ofrefraction.

When a light-ray is refiracted over two parallel refracting surfaces, the Emergent Ray is shifted from the direction of incidentray as shown in the figure. Such atransfer of light rays is called the lateral shift.

As showninthe figure 4.1. PO is an incident ray. It msthe angle ofincident i, with the normal. This incident Tay PQ travels fromthesurface AB ofthe glass slab, from a optically rarer medium like airto an optically denser n ike glass. Soits velocity decreases and it bends hne normal andmakes the angleofrefraction r, shere QR IS a refracted ray. The refracted ray QR acts as aincident ray for the surface CD of the glass slab andforms aihangle with the normal. Now when a light ray enters from aoptically denser medium like glasstoan optically rarer Redium like air, its velocity increases, and it bends away tam the norma. This is howthe RS ray exits fromthe glass That is why is called an Emergent Ray. In the figure, ishie angleof emergence.

Due to this lateral shift as a result ofrefraction, the pencil placed in a glass filled with water appears to be slanted from its surface. Anything placed atthe bottom of a vessel filled with water or at the bottom of aswimming pool appears to beslightly upper than its original location. These phenomena are caused by therefraction oflight. It is difficult to pierce afish in a river as its location looks diferent from where it is due to the refraction oflight.

The Refractive indexhas no unit as it is t theratio of twosimilar quantities. quantities.

## 4.1.2 Laws of Refraction

1. The incident ray PGLYPH&lt;26&gt;. the refracted ray QR and the normal N,Q N,to the interface of two transparentmedia at the pointofincidence,all lie in the same plane.
2. Incidentray and refracted ray both are in different opticalmedia.
3. Incident ray andrefractedray are always onthe opposite side ofthe normal.
4. 4 When alight-ray travelsfrom the opticallyrarer medium (likeair) to an opticallydenser medium (likeglass),it (the refracted ray) bends towards the normalat the interface. Therefore, the angle ofthe incidence is greater than the angle of refraction (i&gt;).
5. 5 When alight ray enters froman optically denser medium (likeglass) to an optically rarer medium (likeair), it (the refractedray) bends awayfrom thenormal tothe interface. Theangleof incidence is smaller than the angle ofrefraction
6. (i &gt;r). 6 Theray which incidentsatthe normal, passes to the other medium without refraction (i.e. does notchange direction).

## 4.1.3 Refractive Indexand Snell's law

Theratio ofthe sine of an angleof incidenceto the sine ofanangle of refraction is always constant forthe given two media. It is termed asa refractiveindex. Its symbolis u (Mu). Sometimesn (Ita)is also written. It is known as Snell's law.It can be written in the formof a formula as follows:

The refractive index of light can be represented as the ratio ofthe velocities oflight in its twomedia. If the velocities of light in medium-1 and medium-2 are v respectively, then their ratio is called the refractive index of medium 1 relative to medium 2.

## 42.1 Total Internal Reflection

This phenomenon is based ontheprinciple of refraction light. The figure below willbe helpful to understand theincidence total intemal reflection.

Asshowninfigure 4.2, a water container is filled with clear transparentwater. Alight source, fixed at the bottom of thecontaineremits light rays in all directions.These are partially reflected andpartially transmitted.

When a ray of light enters from anopticallv denser medium (here,water) to an optically rarer medium (air), it moves awayfrom the normalat the interface.The AM ray ISa normal ray that comes out without being refracted The ray A0,forms the angle ofincidence alongthe normal, which is slightly refracted and emitted in the form of ray O,B (away from the nomal) and partiallyreflected back to the waterin the form of O,C ray. The ray AO,formsangle of eidence () with thenormal, whichis slight vrefractedandAO41S therayexits in the form of 0,D(awayfromthe normal) returns to the water in the form of O,Eray after beinglarger than partially reflected. Asthe angle ofincidence increases, so doesthe angle of refraction. AndthŁray of light moves away fromthe nornalafterbeing refracted, as can be seenin the figure.As the angle of incidence is increased gradually, the refracted ray O,F travels in the direction parallel to the interfaceseparating both media for a certain angle of () equalto the critical angle (0,).Ataparticular angleof incidence, refracted ray moves parallel to the Surface separating the two media. In this particular case, the angle of refractionbecomes 900 forthe incidence ray 0,f. The angle ofincidence for which the angleof refraction raysheeomes 90o is called the critical angle of the denser meaium with respect to the rarer medium. The refracted ray foundin theposition ofa critical angleis called Critical Ray. Here OF is that critical ray. Inthis situation, the surface Separating both media appears to be illuminated.

Now, iftheangle ofincidence (i) is raisedevenslightly more than the critical angle(0),the incident ray gets this case).That is, here, asshown in the figure,incident ray, completely reflectedbackintothe denser medium (water, in Tully reflected and returned backto the water in the form of O,G This phenomenon is called total internal andeflectionThisphenomenon is trueforanyangle of incidence the critical angle. In this situation, the surface separating both mediaacts as aperfect mirror. Total Internal reflection also obeys the laws ofreflection.

## 4.2.2 Critical Angle

In theprevious paragraph, thephenomenon of total internal reflection was introduced. Total internal reflection (TIR)is the phenomenon that involves the reflection ofall the off the boundary

Inour introduction to TIR, we usedtheexample of incident light light traveling through water towards the boundary with lessdense material such as air. Whentheangle of incidence along the boundary, having an angle of refraction of 90-dense in water reaches acertain critical value, the refracted raylies degrees, This angle ofincidence is known asthe critical angle; it is the largest angle ofincidence forwhich refraction can still occur. For any angle of incidence greater than the critical angle, light will undergo total internal reflection.

So thecritical angle is defined as the angle ofincidence that provides an angle of refraction of90-degrees. Make particular notethat the eritical angle is an angle ofincidence value. For the water-air boundary, the critical angle is 48.6-degrees. For the crown glass-water boundary, the critical angle is 61.0-degrees.The actual value ofthe critical angle is dependent upon the combination of materials present on each side ofthe boundary.

Let's consider two different media -creatively named medium i(incident medium) and medium r(refractive medium). The critical angle is the 0,that gives a 0, value of 90-degrees. If this information is substituted into Snell's Law equation, a generic equation for predictingthe critical angle can bederived. The derivation is shown below.

The critical angle can be calculated by taking the inverse-sine of theratio ofthe indices ofrefraction. The ratio of is a value lessthan 1.0. In fact, for the equation to

Since TIR only occurs if the refractive medium is dense than the incident medium, the value of n, mu greater thanthevalue of n Ifat any time the values for numerator and denominator become accidentally swich the critical angle value cannot be calculated MathematicGLYPH&lt;26&gt; this would involve finding theinverse-sine of a numbe greater than 1.00, which is not possible. Physically, t wouldinvolve findingthe critical angle fora situationin whi the light is traveling from the lessdense medium into the mo medium, which again, is not possible

This equation for the critical angle can be used predict the critical angle forany boundary. provjded indices of refraction of the twomaterials on each sid, boundary are known. Examples of its use areshown beloW

## 8= 48.750 Conditions for Total Internal Reflection

3 Necessary The twonecessary conditions for the total internal reflection are:

- o Thelight musttravel fromanopticallydenser medium to an optically rarer medium.
- The angle of incidence in denser medium must be greaterthan the critical angle for the pair of media.

## I Applications of Total Internal Reflection in Optical Fibers

The bright glitter andsparkling of Crystal glasSs anddiamond glitter are attributed to the total internal reflection. Anal internal reflection in nature gives the illusion of a mirage in the desert. Similarly, looming occurs due to total internal wlection inthepolar or extremely cold regions. That means sailors seethe steamer orship hanging upside down in the used in communication andthe medical field worksonthe principle of total internal reflection.

The optical fibres One thing to note here is that the total internal reflection does not occur when any light ray enters from an optically mediumto anopticallydenser medium. Forobjectswith a large refractive index,the critical angle is less. For example, be aritical angle for the light ray going from diamond to air is ,=24°.This phenomenon is the reason for sparkling glitter en indiamonds andcrystal glass.

Optical fibres are now widely used to send audio or video signalsover long distances. Optical fibres can transmit ignals fromoneplace to another using the phenomenonoftotal internal reflection. They are in the form oflong and thin ores high-quality glass,quartz and plastic materials. Its diameter is about 0.000l centimetres. The central-axialpart GLYPH&lt;26&gt;this fibre is called the core while the core is Suroundedby the layercalled cladding. In an optical tiber , the refactive index of cladding material.

of the core is higher than that Asshown in the figure, when a light ray enters into oneend ofthe optical fiber at a proper acceptance angle, it dergoes multiple total internal reflections andfinally emerges out from the other end ofthe optical fiber. Evenif the optical undergoes total intermal reflectionand passes through it.

## 4.4.2 Characteristics ofLaser

Alaser is an electromagnetic,visibleor invisible, ray of monochromatic light that consists ofan extremely powertu, intense, bright, focused and coherent unidirectional beam of light rays thattravels by tremendous velocity in air or vacun. Alaser beam is highly energetic andhas unique propertiesover conventional ordinary light rays. The light of a nomalbu has all the wavelengths, as shownin figure 4.4, which propagates in all directions. The monochromatic (single waveleng light of a sodium lamp has only one wavelength which spreads in all directions (Figure 4.5). whilethe laser light has ony one wavelength, asshown in figure4.6, which propagates in one powerful direction.

## 4.6 Fiber Optics

## 4.6.1 Introduction - Fiber Optics

When we usetelephone, mobilephone, cable (D-to H)TV orinternet, knowinglyor unknowingly we use fiber optic cable. Fiber optics is a branch of optics that studiesthe propagation oflight waves by dielectric in a transparent mediumoptically denser than air. e.g. Optical fiber. In this chapter, we will look at how these tiny fibers of glass or plastic are made and how light is transmitted through them.

An optical fiber is a cylindrical dielectric wavegid as thick as human hair, made of glass and Vor plastic. asignal ofinformation intheform 1ofalight ray is insenteta one end, exits at the other end, allowing the light waves propagate along its length through the totalintemal retlectn at its walls. During the continuous propagation withina optical fiber, the motion ofalight ray follow the zig-zagP and lanegligibly small portion of thelight is likely to be dissipated through the sidewalls, but most of the ligh emerges at the other end.

This jacket is made of Miyurchane orpolyethylene material.

When light ray is incident to an optical fiber, it travels from one end to the other through total internal reflection within the core. The light entered into the core does not GLYPH&lt;26&gt;issipate through its wall and reflectedbackinto the core when the angle of incidence is greaterthan critical angle at the core-cladding interface. The cladding does not absorb light at all. Thus, the light entering the optical fiber is continuously reflectedfromthe interfaceconnecting the core-cladding as shown in Figure 4.9 and carries it to the eangle ofincidence. for which the angle ofrefraction ecomes 90, is called the critical angle (0).

If thelight ray striking the core-cladding interfaces atan angle less than the media.critical angle, it passesinto the claddingand is transmitted out.

The main function of opticalfiberis to accept and transmit as much lightaspossible from the light source.lts j gatheringability depends on its core size and numericalaperture. The numericalaperture ofa fiber depends on acceptance angleand fractional refractive index change.

This angle 9,is called the acceptance angle for optical iber. The acceptance angle of an optical fiber is the maximumvalue of the angleat which the light ray travels through the fiber-core(without leaking) relativeto the axis of the fiber. Thelightrays givenat an angleofmore than, aues arerefracted in the cladding andhence loses the corresponding light energy. The larger the diameter of the Core, the higher the value of the acceptance angle. Asshown FIgure 4.11, theraysoflight at a solid angle200are dcceptable and also transmitted to thefiber. Therefore, this Cone is said to be an acceptance cone.

## 4.6.6 Numerical Aperture

Thesine value of theacceptance angle is known to be he numerical aperture.

Numerical aperture determines the light gathering capacity ofan optical fiber.A numerical aperture givesa measure ofhow muchlightan optical |fiber can accept. Itcan be seen from Equation (10) that the numerical aperture NA)dependsonly on the refractiveindices of the coreand thecladding. The higherthe valueofnumerical laperture (NA),the greater its ability to accept light from a light source. Generally, NA ranges from 0.13 to 0.50.NA is unitless.

Step Index Optical Fibers

## Multimode Graded Index Optical Fibers

Thediameter of core in graded-index multimode fiber is somewhat between 50to 200micrometer. Thelarg diameter ofthecore allows multipleraysto propagate through the fiber.

The light wavethat travels insidethe fiberchanges its behaviour with time while travelling inside it. As we ha\e already discussedthat the r refractive index of thecore at the axis is i comparativelylarger than atthe other part inside edense Thuswhenlight is allowedis propagate insidethe fiber, then it travels from lessdense medium to more medium. However, we are aware of thefactthat for TIR totake place thelight musttravel from denser torarer medium. So,thelight ray despitebeing reflected getsrefracted inside thecore.

Hence,the light on travelling gets scontinuously refracted and bends.Thusin caseof graded-index multimode fibet propagate in theform of skew rays S or helical rays the light rays donot propagate by followingastraight line, rather they propagate in Theywillnotcrossthefiberaxis.thisis due to the graduallychange inthe

## 4.8 Advantages of opticalfibersover Coaxial | cables

Radio waves and microwavesare used to carry infonation in electronic communication. Duetotheir limited bandwidth, their information (data)carryingcapacity is low, soit is not sufficient for modern needs. If light waves are used insteadofradio wavesandmicrowaves, the numberof signals increases considerably and can be transmitted simultancously.

Optical fiber has many advantages over conventional Coaxial cables.

- (1) Opticalfibers are cheaper. Optical fiber is made from silica (SiO,), which is found in abundance very cheaply.
- (2) Optical fiber is small in size, light in weight, flexible and has good mechanicalstrength. Duetoits small size, a cable of a given diameter can be bundled (inthe formofacable)with more opticalfibersthan acopper wire. Which allows moretelephone linesfromasinglecableormore TV channels from a singlecable to reach ourTV.
- (3) Optical fiber is not harmful. If a normal conductor wire breaks accidentally, a short circuit occurs in the high voltage line and the sparks cause great damage to the combustible gases in the area.While such accidents donot occur due to the insulatingproperties of optical fiber.
- (4) Electromagnetic radio frequency interferences (EMI) and radio frequency interferences (RFI) donot affect optical fibers. Photons are electrically neutral and therefore do not experience the effects of background noise caused by disturbances of high voltage, electricity or electromagnetic interference (EMI) or radio frequency interference (RFI) like plain conductive wires.
- (5) Optical fiber reduces the possibility of backgroundand cross-talks. In communication through copper wire cable, the signal keeps

- moving fromone circuit t 1 toanother,, resufting other calls being heard in the background well.Thelight waves passing through the o fiber do nottleak. Becauseof this,. even if alt optical fiber clusters are taken as a cable, the possibility of cross-talk is less.
- (6) Optical fiber has higher bandwidth.Ther of transmission ofanyinformation data is rela to its signal frequency. Thefrequency oflight very high i.e. of theorder of 10l4 to 10!5 H While the frequency of radio waves is in the order of1oandthe frequcncy of microwaveGLYPH&lt;26&gt; 108 Hz 101°Hz. Therefore the rate d transmission of information bylight is higher tha that ofradio waves or microwaves.A typical telephone cable, made up of900 conducting wires, can handle 10,000calls, whilel mn optical fiber can handle 50,000 calls. Thus, optical fiber can carry large amounts of information.
- (7) Optical fiber has low transmission loss per unit length and noise-free
- safety is maintained. (9) Optical fiber is more efficient than electrical conducting wire, as it requires fewer repeaters and saves both maintenanceand costs.
- transmission. (8) In Optical fiber,light signals doesnotspread outmuch sosignal
- (10)The tensile strength of the optical iber very high. And it can be bend.
- years. (12) Optical fiber is temperature resistant. That is, unlike copper wire, it can withstand high
- (11) Optical fiber can be used for a long timt Optical fiber lasts for 20-30 years, while coppe wire lasts for 12-15
- temperatures. (13) Optical fiber transmits digitall informatio through digital signals, which is especi useful in computers. especially

## SUMMARY

## Laws of Refraction

refracted ray bends away from the normal to t interface. The angle ofincidence is smaller than angle of refraction(i&lt; ).

1. The incident ray, the refracted ray and the normal to the interface of two transparentmediaat the point of incidence,all are in the same plane.
2. Incident ray and refractedray are in different optical media and on the opposite side ofthe normal.
3. When a light-raypasses through an optically rarer (thin)medium (likeair) to an opticallydenser (thick) medium (likeglass), the efracted ray bends towards the nornal to the interface. Therefore, the angle ofthe incidence is greater than the angle of refraction (i &gt; n).
4. When a light ray passes through a denser medium (like glass) to an optically rarer medium (like air), the
5. The ray whichincidents at the normal, returms int samedirection (but does not change direction).

- O. Snell'slaw :Ratio of sineofthe angle of incidence the sine of theangle of refraction is always constart the given two media. It is termed as refractive inds Its symbol is u (Mu). Sometimes u (Ita) is as written. 6

The refractive index of lightcan be representeo ratio of the velocities of light in its two media. If velocities of light in medium-1 and medium-2 and v2 respectively, thentheir ratio is called refractive index of medium I relative to medium
