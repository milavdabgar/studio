Prerequisite:     Fundamental knowledge of Chemistry and basic Arithmetic for simple
calculations.
Rationale:        The background of chemistry allows engineers to get the most out of raw elements
in creating fuels, drugs, new and modern materials, construction materials, etc.
needed in wide variety of engineering and technological applications. The in-
depth comprehension of concepts and chemical reactions involved in chemistry
would be applicable in solving the problems of engineering in spectrum of
engineering branches like, Electrical Engineering, Power Electronics Engineering,
Biomedical Engineering, etc. The deep understanding of various topics/ subtopics

understand and solve the various engineering problems, developments and
breakthrough in engineering and technology in a very systematic and scientific
way. Engineering chemistry helps to develop and enhance the thinking capabilities
of the diploma pass outs in line with the modern trends in engineering and
technology through the inclusion of various creative activities/micro projects etc.
Many global problems/issues and their in-depth understanding is addressed
through the inclusion of topics of relevance like atomic structure, chemical
bonding and solutions; electrochemistry; corrosion; fuels; lubricants, polymers,
elastomers, insulating materials and semiconductors; electrochemical energy
sources in this course.
