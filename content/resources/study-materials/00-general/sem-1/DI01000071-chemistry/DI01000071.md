| **Rationale**          | The background of chemistry allows engineers to get the most out of raw elements in creating fuels, drugs, new and modern materials, construction materials, etc. needed in wide variety of engineering and technological applications. The in-depth comprehension of concepts and chemical reactions involved in chemistry would be applicable in solving the problems of engineering in spectrum of engineering branches like, Electrical Engineering, Power Electronics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, etc. The deep understanding of various topics/subtopics of Engineering Chemistry course would enable the diploma engineers to understand and solve the various engineering problems, developments and breakthrough in engineering and technology in a very systematic and scientific way. Engineering chemistry helps to develop and enhance the thinking capabilities of the diploma pass outs in line with the modern trends in engineering and technology through the inclusion of various creative activities/micro projects etc. Many global problems/issues and their in-depth understanding is addressed through the inclusion of topics of relevance like atomic structure, chemical bonding and solutions; electrochemistry; corrosion; fuels; lubricants, polymers, elastomers, insulating materials and semiconductors; electrochemical energy sources in this course. |
