1 or 2

Category of the Course:

Basic Science Courses

Prerequisite:

Fundamental knowledge of Chemistry and basic Arithmetic for simple calculations.

Rationale:

The background of chemistry allows engineers to get the most out of raw elements in  creating  fuels,  drugs,  new  and  modern  materials,  construction  materials,  etc. needed  in  wide  variety  of  engineering  and  technological  applications.  The  indepth  comprehension  of  concepts  and  chemical  reactions  involved  in  chemistry would  be  applicable  in  solving  the  problems  of  engineering  in  spectrum  of engineering branches like, Electrical Engineering, Power Electronics Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, etc. The deep understanding of various topics/ subtopics of Engineering Chemistry course would enable the diploma engineers to understand  and  solve the various engineering  problems,  developments  and breakthrough  in  engineering  and  technology  in  a  very  systematic  and  scientific way. Engineering chemistry helps to develop and enhance the thinking capabilities of  the  diploma  pass  outs  in  line  with  the  modern  trends  in  engineering  and technology through the inclusion of various creative activities/micro projects etc. Many  global  problems/issues  and  their  in-depth  understanding  is  addressed through  the  inclusion  of  topics  of  relevance  like  atomic  structure,  chemical bonding  and  solutions;  electrochemistry;  corrosion;  fuels;  lubricants,  polymers, elastomers, insulating materials and  semiconductors;  electrochemical  energy sources in this course.
