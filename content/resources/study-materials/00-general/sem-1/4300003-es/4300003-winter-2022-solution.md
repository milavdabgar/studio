```

**Rainwater harvesting** is the collection, storage, and utilization of rainwater for beneficial purposes.

**Components of rainwater harvesting system**:

**1. Catchment area**:

- **Function**: Surface for rain collection (rooftops, open areas)
- **Material**: Should be clean, non-toxic (avoid asbestos, lead-painted surfaces)
- **Calculation**: Collection = Catchment area × Rainfall × Runoff coefficient

**2. Collection and conveyance system**:

- **Gutters**: Channel water from catchment surface
- **Downspouts**: Vertical pipes carrying water from gutters
- **Transportation**: Pipes connecting different components

**3. First flush diverter**:

- **Purpose**: Removes initial dirty water containing debris
- **Types**: Manual valve, automatic diverter, floating ball system
- **Capacity**: Usually 10-15 liters per 100 sq.m of roof area

**4. Filtration system**:

- **Coarse filter**: Removes leaves, debris (mesh screen)
- **Fine filter**: Sand, gravel, activated carbon
- **Slow sand filter**: Biological treatment for drinking water

**5. Storage system**:

- **Surface storage**: Tanks, reservoirs above ground
- **Underground storage**: Sumps, cisterns below ground
- **Material**: Ferrocement, plastic, concrete, fiberglass

**Types of rainwater harvesting**:

**A. Rooftop harvesting**:

- **Direct storage**: Rainwater stored in tanks for immediate use
- **Indirect recharge**: Water directed to recharge groundwater

**B. Surface water harvesting**:

- **Check dams**: Small barriers across streams
- **Percolation tanks**: Artificial recharge structures
- **Contour bunding**: Soil conservation with water harvesting

**Benefits**:

- **Water security**: Reduces dependence on external water sources
- **Groundwater recharge**: Prevents water table decline
- **Flood control**: Reduces surface runoff and urban flooding
- **Quality improvement**: Generally better than groundwater in polluted areas
- **Cost-effective**: Lower than water supply schemes
- **Energy saving**: Reduces pumping requirements

**Design considerations**:

- **Rainfall pattern**: Seasonal distribution, intensity
- **Water demand**: Household requirements, usage patterns
- **Storage capacity**: Based on dry period duration
- **Quality requirements**: Potable vs non-potable use
- **Site conditions**: Space availability, soil permeability

**Maintenance requirements**:

- **Regular cleaning**: Gutters, filters, storage tanks
- **Roof maintenance**: Prevent contamination sources
- **System inspection**: Check for leaks, blockages
- **Water quality testing**: Periodic analysis for potable use

**Government initiatives**:

- **Building codes**: Mandatory rainwater harvesting in new constructions
- **Subsidies**: Financial incentives for installation
- **Awareness programs**: Community education and training
- **Technical support**: Design guidelines, implementation assistance

**Challenges**:

- **Initial cost**: Setup expenses for complete system
- **Maintenance**: Regular upkeep requirements
- **Space requirements**: Storage tank space needs
- **Seasonal availability**: Dependence on monsoon patterns
- **Quality concerns**: Potential contamination issues

**Calculation example**:

- Roof area: 100 sq.m
- Annual rainfall: 1000 mm
- Runoff coefficient: 0.8
- Harvestable water = 100 × 1 × 0.8 = 80,000 liters/year
