## 1. Rationale

For a country to progress, sustainable development is one of the key factors. Environment
conservation and hazard management is of much importance to every citizen of India.
Considerable amount of energy is being wasted. Energy saved is energy produced.
Environmental pollution is on the rise due to rampant industrial mismanagement and
indiscipline. Renewable energy is one of the answers to the energy crisis and also to reduce
environmental pollution. Therefore this course has been designed to develop a general
awareness of these and related issues so that the every student will start acting as a
responsible citizen to make the country and the world a better place to live in.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Adopt the sustainable practices to resolve the environment related issues.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (Cos)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:
- Adopt relevant ecofriendly product in the given situation to protect ecosystem
- use relevant method of pollution reduction in the given situation
- Use of renewable resources of energy for sustainable development
- Use the relevant techniques in given context to reduce impact due to climate change
Use relevant laws and policies for developing the sustainable environmental

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level
of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should
gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students
and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher
to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare
reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their
(student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare specification of some renewable sources of energy.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams
- Give seminar on any relevant topic.
- Undertake a market survey of different green materials.
- Prepare showcase portfolios.
- Prepare report on various issues related to environment and sustainable development
- Publish a research paper on themes related to environment and sustainable
development.
- Compare the pollution (water, air and noise) data of various cities with standard values
as laid by pollution control board.
- Undertake some small mini projects on various issues related to environment and
sustainable development.
- Submit a report on visit to an energy park
- Prepare power point on clean and green technologies
- Submit a report on visit to garbage disposal system in your city/town.
- Submit a report on analysis of the life cycle of any one or two eco-friendly product/s.
- Calculate ecological footprint using various calculator available on web with a report
recommending ways and means to reduce ecological footprint.
- Give seminar on relevant topic.
- Undertake micro-projects.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.

Environment and Sustainability                                                Course Code: .................

- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability
- Guide students for using data manuals.
- Guide students for using data manuals.
- Arrange visit to nearby industries and workshops for understanding various sources of
pollution.
- Use video/animation films to explain various processes related to environment and
sustainable development
- Use different instructional strategies in classroom teaching.
- Write the report on properties of various eco-friendly construction materials like
Stone, aggregate of different sizes, timber, lime, bitumen, Bricks, tiles, precast
concrete products, Water proofing material, Termite proofing material, Thermal
insulating material, plaster of Paris, paints, distemper, and varnishes.
- Display various technical brochures of recent projects/themes related to environment
and sustainable development
- Visit the Pollution control board office and its various projects to demonstrate the
various practices adopted for control of Pollution

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so
that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have
to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a
seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should
not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

       A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and
the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Natural cycles: Build a Chart showing different natural cycles like Carbon,
       Nitrogen,Sulphur and phosphorus cycle.)
- Solar Energy: Build a model of Solar water heater/Solar cooker
- Wind energy: Build a model of wind mill
- Best out of waste: Build useful items from waste materials like used plastic bottles,
       discarded pens etc.
