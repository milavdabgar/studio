## 1. RATIONALE

For a country to progress, sustainable development is one of the key factors. Environment conservation  and  hazard  management  is  of  much  importance  to  every  citizen  of  India. Considerable  amount  of  energy  is  being  wasted.  Energy  saved  is  energy  produced. Environmental  pollution  is  on  the  rise  due  to  rampant  industrial  mismanagement  and indiscipline. Renewable energy is one of the answers to the energy crisis and also to reduce environmental  pollution.  Therefore  this  course  has  been  designed  to  develop  a  general awareness  of  these  and  related  issues  so  that  the  every  student  will  start  acting  as  a responsible citizen to make the country and the world a better place to live in.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

- Adopt the sustainable practices to resolve the environment related issues.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (Cos)

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Natural cycles : Build a Chart showing different natural cycles like Carbon, Nitrogen,Sulphur and phosphorus cycle.)
- b) Solar Energy: Build a model of Solar water heater/Solar cooker
- c) Wind energy: Build a model of wind mill
- d) Best out of waste :  Build useful items from waste materials like used plastic bottles, discarded pens etc.


- e) Compare the pollution (water, air and noise) data of various cities with standard values as laid by pollution control board.
- f) Surf different websites related environment and sustainable development, Pollution control.
- g) Prepare energy audit report of any residential building.
- h) Collect relevant information about the software used in pollution control.
- o) Visit  to  ongoing  project  and  study  various  aspects  related  to  environment  and sustainable development
