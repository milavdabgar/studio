  "rationale": "For a country to progress, sustainable development is one of the key factors. Environment conservation and hazard management is of much importance to every citizen of India. Considerable amount of energy is being wasted. Energy saved is energy produced. Environmental pollution is on the rise due to rampant industrial mismanagement and indiscipline. Renewable energy is one of the answers to the energy crisis and also to reduce environmental pollution. Therefore this course has been designed to develop a general awareness of these and related issues so that the every student will start acting as a responsible citizen to make the country and the world a better place to live in.",
