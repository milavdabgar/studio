## Question 2(B) [8 marks]

**Attempt any two.**

### 1. Answer in brief

**(i) Why did the author return to mountains?**

**Answer**:
In "The Leopard," the author returned to the mountains to escape the chaos of city life and find peace in nature. He was drawn to the solitude and beauty of the mountain environment, particularly to observe wildlife in their natural habitat. The mountains offered him a sanctuary where he could connect with nature and experience the harmony of the wilderness away from human interference.

**(ii) What did the stranger say to the policeman?**

**Answer**:
In "After Twenty Years," the stranger (Bob) told the policeman that he was waiting for his friend Jimmy Wells, with whom he had made an appointment twenty years ago to meet at that exact spot. He explained their friendship from childhood, described how successful he had become out West, and expressed confidence that Jimmy would honor their commitment despite the passage of time.

### 2. Answer in brief

**(i) What does the poet say about the owner of the woods?**

**Answer**:
In "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening," the poet mentions that the owner of the woods lives in the village and will not see him stopping there. This suggests the owner is absent, allowing the speaker to pause and admire the woods privately. The reference emphasizes the speaker's temporary intrusion into someone else's property while enjoying a moment of natural beauty.

**(ii) What are the communication skills?**

**Answer**:
Communication skills are abilities that enable effective exchange of information, ideas, and emotions. These include verbal skills (speaking and writing clearly), non-verbal skills (body language, facial expressions), listening skills (active attention and understanding), and interpersonal skills (empathy, feedback, and adaptation to different audiences). They are essential for personal and professional success.

### 3. Answer in brief

**(i) What kind of man was his friend Jimmy?**

**Answer**:
Jimmy Wells was portrayed as an honest, principled, and loyal man who became a police officer. He was someone who kept his promises (meeting Bob after twenty years) but also upheld his professional duties and moral obligations. Jimmy showed both compassion and integrity by arranging for another officer to arrest Bob while explaining his actions through a personal note, demonstrating his internal conflict between friendship and duty.

**(ii) What is the basic model of communication?**

**Answer**:
The basic model of communication includes five essential elements: Sender (who creates the message), Message (the information being communicated), Channel (the medium of transmission), Receiver (who interprets the message), and Feedback (response confirming understanding). This linear model shows how information flows from one person to another, with potential for noise or barriers to interfere with effective transmission.

## Question 5(A) [6 marks]

**Attempt any two.**

### 1. Write a paragraph on "Importance of Trees"

**Answer**:
Trees play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance and supporting life on Earth. They act as natural air purifiers by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen through photosynthesis, helping combat air pollution and climate change. Trees prevent soil erosion, maintain groundwater levels, and provide habitat for countless species of birds and animals. Economically, they supply timber, fruits, medicines, and various forest products that sustain human livelihood. Trees also offer psychological benefits by creating peaceful environments and reducing stress. Their shade provides natural cooling, reducing the need for air conditioning and conserving energy. During monsoons, trees help prevent floods by absorbing excess water. In urban areas, they improve air quality and enhance the beauty of landscapes. The presence of trees increases property values and creates pleasant living spaces. Therefore, protecting existing forests and planting more trees is essential for environmental sustainability and human survival.

### 2. Write a paragraph on "Diwali"

**Answer**:
Diwali, also known as the Festival of Lights, is one of the most significant and widely celebrated festivals in India. This five-day festival symbolizes the victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance. The celebration commemorates Lord Rama's return to Ayodhya after defeating Ravana and completing fourteen years of exile. People clean and decorate their homes with colorful rangoli patterns, diyas (oil lamps), and electric lights to welcome prosperity and happiness. Families gather to perform Lakshmi Puja, seeking blessings for wealth and prosperity from Goddess Lakshmi. The festival involves exchanging sweets and gifts with relatives and friends, strengthening social bonds and relationships. Fireworks and crackers light up the night sky, creating a spectacular display of colors and sounds. Traditional sweets like laddu, barfi, and gulab jamun are prepared and shared with everyone. Markets buzz with activity as people shop for new clothes, jewelry, and decorative items. Diwali transcends religious boundaries and brings communities together in celebration of hope, renewal, and the triumph of positive forces.
