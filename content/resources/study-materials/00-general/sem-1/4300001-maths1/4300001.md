## 1. Rationale

This course of Mathematics is being introduced as a foundation which will help students in
developing competency and the requisite course outcomes in most of the Diploma
Engineering programs. Components of Mathematics like Algebra, Geometry, Calculus,
Computer computation work as a tool to describe physical phenomena and to evaluate the
merit of different possible solutions. This course is an attempt to initiate the multi-
dimensional logical thinking and reasoning capabilities. It will help the students to apply the
basic principles of Mathematics to solve related technology problems. The course will give
the students an insight to apply and analyse the Engineering problems scientifically based on
the subject of Trigonometry, Differential Calculus and Basic elements of algebra and
coordinate geometry to give a comprehensive coverage at an introductory level.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
Solve broad-based technology problems using the principles of mathematics.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:
- Interpret the function graphically, numerically and analytically.
- Demonstrate the ability to algebraically analyse basic functions used in Trigonometry.
- Demonstrate the ability to Crack engineering related problems based on concepts of
Vectors.

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:

‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
      ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
      iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- Identify engineering problems based on real world problems relevant to content
of the unit and solve these problems in the light of free tutorials available on the
internet.
- Explore the opportunity to visit Science city, ISRO or nearby Science centres.
- Explore the opportunity to visit Mathematics Lab Virtually.
- Prepare charts showing formulas of multiple and sub multiple trigonometric
functions.
- Use Graphing calculator to plot the graph of functions showing Engineering
applications.
- Collect set of problems based on concept of limit with real world applications and
make a presentation.
- Communicate mathematical thinking coherently and clearly to other students,
peers, and others.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L” in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Explore the possibility for understanding the Biosphere through Mathematics
- Guide students for using data manuals.

- 2.SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more

## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
 maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give
 a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be
 about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course.The students
 ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-
 oriented COs).
        A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly with
competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the
concerned course teacher:
- Draw graphs of given Functions like 2 x − 1, x 2 ,sin x, cos x etc and verify using
            suitable Open-source software like GeoGebra, DPLOT and GRAPH.
- Prepare the Charts of formulae for limit, Vector, Trigonometry, Co-ordinate
            Geometry, and Logarithm.
- Prepare the cardboard models based on Mathematical concepts.
- Draw various lines, circles using GeoGebra software.
- Prepare projects on height and distance using Trigonometry.
- Use PHET website for simulation of Vector Algebra.
- Prepare a presentation/seminar on any relevant topic of interdisciplinary nature.
- Prepare a write up on the Historical path of Calculus.
- Prepare models of graphical representation for the existence of limits of given
            functions.
- Prepare charts showing formulas of multiple and sub multiple trigonometric
            functions and its usefulness.
- Formulate models to describe mathematical relationships and analyze data.
