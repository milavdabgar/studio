Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Identify engineering problems based on real world problems relevant to content of the unit and solve these problems in the light of free tutorials available on the internet.
- b) Explore the opportunity to visit Science city, ISRO or nearby Science centres.
- c) Explore the opportunity to visit Mathematics Lab Virtually.
- d) Prepare charts showing formulas of multiple and sub multiple trigonometric functions.
- e) Use Graphing calculator to plot the graph of functions showing Engineering applications.
- f) Collect set of problems based on concept of limit with real world applications and make a presentation.
- g) Communicate  mathematical  thinking  coherently  and  clearly  to  other  students, peers, and others.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive  open  online  courses  ( MOOCs )  may  be  used  to  teach  various  topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- f) Explore the possibility for understanding the Biosphere through Mathematics
- g) Guide students for using data manuals.

## 12.SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more

COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industryoriented COs).

- A  suggestive  list  of  micro-projects  is  given  here.  This  should  relate  highly  with competency  of  the  course  and  the  COs.  Similar  micro-projects  could  be  added  by  the concerned course teacher:
- a) Draw  graphs  of  given  Functions  like 2 2 1, , sin , cos x x x x -etc  and  verify  using suitable Open-source software like GeoGebra, DPLOT and GRAPH.
- b) Prepare  the  Charts  of  formulae  for  limit,  Vector,  Trigonometry,  Co-ordinate Geometry, and Logarithm.
- c) Prepare the cardboard models based on Mathematical concepts.
- d) Draw various lines, circles using GeoGebra software.
- e) Prepare projects on height and distance using Trigonometry.
- f) Use PHET website for simulation of Vector Algebra.
- g) Prepare a presentation/seminar on any relevant topic of interdisciplinary nature.
- h) Prepare a write up on the Historical path of Calculus.
- i) Prepare  models  of  graphical  representation  for  the  existence  of  limits  of  given functions.
- j) Prepare  charts  showing  formulas  of  multiple  and  sub  multiple  trigonometric functions and its usefulness.
- k) Formulate models to describe mathematical relationships and analyze data.
