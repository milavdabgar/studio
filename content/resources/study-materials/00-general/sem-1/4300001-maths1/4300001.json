  "rationale": "This course of Mathematics is being introduced as a foundation which will help students in developing competency and the requisite course outcomes in most of the Diploma Engineering programs. Components of Mathematics like Algebra, Geometry, Calculus, Computer computation work as a tool to describe physical phenomena and to evaluate the merit of different possible solutions. This course is an attempt to initiate the multi-dimensional logical thinking and reasoning capabilities. It will help the students to apply the basic principles of Mathematics to solve related technology problems. The course will give the students an insight to apply and analyse the Engineering problems scientifically based on the subject of Trigonometry, Differential Calculus and Basic elements of algebra and coordinate geometry to give a comprehensive coverage at an introductory level.",
