## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in groups and prepare reports of each activity.

1. Prepare journals based on practical performance in the laboratory
2. Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edX, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning. Prepare chart to represent the Network Topology Diagrams, Protocol Stack Diagrams, Flowcharts for Protocols, Error and Flow Control Graphs, Bandwidth Utilization Charts, Network Performance Metrics, Comparison Charts for Data Link Protocols, Routing Algorithm Comparison Graphs, IP Addressing Schemes, Network Security Charts, Comparison of Wireless Technologies, Network Management Tools Comparison, Data Communication Medium Comparison, Ethical Hacking Incidents etc
3. Explore real-world case studies of network implementations, failures, or security breaches, encouraging students to analyze and propose solutions
4. To design a network in your department such as one drive can be accessible from any other system
5. Prepare LAN cable and test it (Practice cable stripping, untwisting, and proper crimping techniques, Learn about different types of LAN cables, such as Cat5e, Cat6, or Cat6a, and their applications, Create a simple diagram or documentation illustrating the cable connections)
6. List different types of Network operating system
7. Identify the type of Network in your Institute
