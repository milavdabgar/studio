| Rationale:      | Digital technology-the fastest growing technology has revolutionized the electronics  Industry.  In  most  of  the  applications  digital  technology  has  replaced  analogue  technology.  Digital  logic  is  the  heart  of  digital  electronic  circuits.  A  basic  understanding  of  this  subject  is  therefore  essential  to  effective  maintenance  of  the  digital electronic devices. The study of this course will enable the students to test the  working  and  rectify  the  faults  of  common  digital  circuits.  The  syllabus  has  been  designed to make students know about fundamental principles of Digital Electronics  and gain familiarity with the available IC chips. |

## Course Outcome:

## Note:

- i.  More  Practical  Exercises  can  be  designed  and  offered  by  the  respective  course  teacher  to develop  the  industry  relevant  skills/outcomes  to  match  the  COs.  The  above  table  is  only  a suggestive list.
- ii. Care must be taken in assigning and assessing study report as it is a first year study report. Study report, data collection and analysis report must be assigned in a group. Teacher has to discuss  about  type  of  data  (which  and  why)  before  group  start  their  market  survey.  The following are some sample 'Process' and 'Product' related skills (more may be added/deleted

## Suggested Project List:

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three .

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based,  laboratorybased  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs  which  are  in  fact,  an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project  work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during  the  course.  The  students  ought  to  submit  micro-project  by  the  end  of  the  semester  to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive  list  of  micro-projects  is  given  here.  This  has  to  match  the  competency  and  the  COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- (i) Implement Logic Gates on General Purpose Board.
- (ii) Implement simplified Product of Sum (POS) based equation using logic gates on General Purpose Board.
- (iii) Design Half Adder/Full Adder Circuit on General Purpose Board.
- (iv) Design Half Subtractor/Full Subtractor Circuit on General Purpose Board.
- (v) Design 4:1 Multiplexer on General Purpose Board.
- (vi) Design 4 bit Gray to Binary code converter on General Purpose Board.
- (vii) Design 4 bit Binary to Gray code converter on General Purpose Board Design any Flipflop on General Purpose Board.
- (viii) Design 4-bit Counter on General Purpose Board.
- (ix) Identify Various types of Memories like Pen Drive, Hard Disk, DVD, Memory Card etc. around you and Prepare a comparison chart of it.
- (x) Identify E-Waste of Digital ICs and Prepare a brief Report of Remedies for it.

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  student-related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages

for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their  (student's)  portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- (i) Read and note down specifications of Digital ICs using data sheet: IC number/ Pin Diagram/voltage levels, applications for the following Digital ICs (TTL/CMOS): AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, EXOR,  EX-NOR  gates,  Decoder,  Multiplexer,  BCD  to  7-segment  decoder,  SR  FF,JK  FF,  D  FF,  shift Register, Counter, ADC, DAC.
- (ii) Solve real life problems using binary logic theory and implement it using digital logic circuits.
- (iii) Explore working of Digital clock/Digital panel.
- (iv)  Prepare micro project using Various Digital IC and display devices.
