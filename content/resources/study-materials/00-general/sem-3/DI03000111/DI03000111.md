Prerequisite:    ----

Digital technology-the fastest growing technology has revolutionized the electronics
Industry. In most of the applications digital technology has replaced analogue
technology. Digital logic is the heart of digital electronic circuits. A basic
understanding of this subject is therefore essential to effective maintenance of the
Rationale:
digital electronic devices. The study of this course will enable the students to test the
working and rectify the faults of common digital circuits. The syllabus has been
designed to make students know about fundamental principles of Digital Electronics
and gain familiarity with the available IC chips.

Course Outcome:
The course content should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop different types of skills
so that students are able to acquire following competency:

ii. Care must be taken in assigning and assessing study report as it is a first year study report.
Study report, data collection and analysis report must be assigned in a group. Teacher has to
discuss about type of data (which and why) before group start their market survey. The
following are some sample ‘Process’ and ‘Product’ related skills (more may be added/deleted

Suggested Project List:
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her
in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group
of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not
exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-
based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an

integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of
individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission.
The duration of the microproject should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement
hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to
develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs.
Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

     (i) Implement Logic Gates on General Purpose Board.
     (ii) Implement simplified Product of Sum (POS) based equation using logic gates on General
     (iii) Design Half Adder/Full Adder Circuit on General Purpose Board.
     (iv) Design Half Subtractor/Full Subtractor Circuit on General Purpose Board.
     (v) Design 4:1 Multiplexer on General Purpose Board.
     (vi) Design 4 bit Gray to Binary code converter on General Purpose Board.
     (vii)      Design 4 bit Binary to Gray code converter on General Purpose Board Design any Flip-
          flop on General Purpose Board.
     (viii)     Design 4-bit Counter on General Purpose Board.
     (ix) Identify Various types of Memories like Pen Drive, Hard Disk, DVD, Memory Card etc.
         around you and Prepare a comparison chart of it.
     (x) Identify E-Waste of Digital ICs and Prepare a brief Report of Remedies for it.
Suggested Activities for Students:
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages

for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio
which may be useful for their placement interviews:

(i) Read and note down specifications of Digital ICs using data sheet: IC number/ Pin Diagram/voltage
levels, applications for the following Digital ICs (TTL/CMOS): AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, EX-
- R, EX-NOR gates, Decoder, Multiplexer, BCD to 7-segment decoder, SR FF,JK FF, D FF, shift
Register, Counter, ADC, DAC.
(ii) Solve real life problems using binary logic theory and implement it using digital logic circuits.
(iii) Explore working of Digital clock/Digital panel.
(iv) Prepare micro project using Various Digital IC and display devices.
