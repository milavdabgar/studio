## Note

1. More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a suggestive list.
2. Care must be taken in assigning and assessing study report as it is a first year study report. Study report, data collection and analysis report must be assigned in a group. Teacher has to discuss about type of data (which and why) before group start their market survey. The following are some sample 'Process' and 'Product' related skills (more may be added/deleted depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises of this course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

## Suggested Project List

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-projects are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro-project should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. Implement Logic Gates on General Purpose Board
2. Implement simplified Product of Sum (POS) based equation using logic gates on General Purpose Board
3. Design Half Adder/Full Adder Circuit on General Purpose Board
4. Design Half Subtractor/Full Subtractor Circuit on General Purpose Board
5. Design 4:1 Multiplexer on General Purpose Board
6. Design 4 bit Gray to Binary code converter on General Purpose Board
7. Design 4 bit Binary to Gray code converter on General Purpose Board
8. Design any Flip-flop on General Purpose Board
9. Design 4-bit Counter on General Purpose Board
10. Identify Various types of Memories like Pen Drive, Hard Disk, DVD, Memory Card etc. around you and Prepare a comparison chart of it
11. Identify E-Waste of Digital ICs and Prepare a brief Report of Remedies for it

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

1. Read and note down specifications of Digital ICs using data sheet: IC number/Pin Diagram/voltage levels, applications for the following Digital ICs (TTL/CMOS): AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, EXOR, EX-NOR gates, Decoder, Multiplexer, BCD to 7-segment decoder, SR FF, JK FF, D FF, shift Register, Counter, ADC, DAC
2. Solve real life problems using binary logic theory and implement it using digital logic circuits
3. Explore working of Digital clock/Digital panel
4. Prepare micro project using Various Digital IC and display devices
