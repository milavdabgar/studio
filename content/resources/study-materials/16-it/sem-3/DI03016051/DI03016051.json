  "rationale": "Java is a versatile, general-purpose programming language that is open-source, platform-independent, class-based, and object-oriented, featuring an extensive library ecosystem. It is widely recognized for its simplicity, portability, reliability, and is designed to be robust, secure, dynamic, and architecture-neutral. The \"write once, run anywhere\" principle allows Java code to run on any platform that supports Java without needing to be recompiled. With strong industry support, Java is essential for many technologies such as Java Server Pages (JSP) and Android app development. This course equips students with the essential skills needed to develop object-oriented applications in Java and will enable them to solve real-world programming challenges.",
