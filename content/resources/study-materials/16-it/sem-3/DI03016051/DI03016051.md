| Rationale:      | Java  is  a  versatile,  general-purpose  programming  language  that  is  open-source,  platform-independent,  class-based,  and  object-oriented,  featuring  an  extensive  library  ecosystem.  It  is  widely  recognized  for  its  simplicity,  portability,  reliability, and is designed to be robust, secure, dynamic, and architecture-neutral.  The  "write  once,  run  anywhere"  principle  allows  Java  code  to  run  on  any  platform  that  supports  Java  without  needing  to  be  recompiled.  With  strong  industry  support,  Java  is  essential  for  many  technologies  such  as  Java  Server  Pages (JSP) and Android app development.  This course equips students with the  essential  skills  needed  to  develop  object-oriented  applications  in  Java  and  will  enable them to solve real-world programming challenges. |

|  7 | Develop  a  program  to  demonstrate  single  level  inheritance,  multilevel  inheritance, and hierarchical inheritance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | III |  2 |
|  8 | Develop  a  program  with  one  class  named  shape  which  has  two  member  functions  named  erase  ()  and  draw().  In  the  program  we  have  three  other  subclasses:  circle,  triangle  and  square.  Override  methods  of  the  superclass  into subclasses.                                                                                                                        | III |  2 |
|  9 | Develop a java program that illustrates interface inheritance. Interface 'A1'  and  'A2'  are  extended  from  interface  'A'.  Interface  'A12'  inherited  from  both 'A1' and 'A2'. Each interface declares one method and one constant.  Class 'Interface_Imple' implements 'A12'. Instantiate 'Interface_Imple' and  invoke each of its methods. Each method displays one of the constants. | III |  2 |
| 10 | Develop a program to create a Package and demonstrate how packages are  used in java. And use java access modifier to demonstrate the access rules in  a package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | III |  2 |
| 11 | Develop a program to demonstrate the use of 'super' and 'final' keywords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | III |  2 |
| 12 | A) Develop a program to handle multiple exceptions using multiple catch  blocks.  B) Develop  a  program  to  demonstrate  use  of  throw,  throws,  and  finally  keyword.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | IV  |  2 |
| 13 | Develop a program that executes two threads. One thread will print the even  numbers  and  the  another  thread  will  print  odd  numbers  between  1  to  10.(Create the thread by implementing runnable interface)                                                                                                                                                                            | IV  |  2 |
| 14 | Develop programs to create, write, modify, read operations on Text files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | V   |  2 |

Case Study 3: Develop a library book issue management system.

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student- related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity.
