**GUJARAT TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY**

**Program Name:** Engineering  
**Level:** Diploma  
**Branch:** Information Technology  
**Course/Subject Code:** DI03016051  
**Course/Subject Name:** Object Oriented Programming with JAVA

| **Academic Year** | **2024-25**                                                  |

| **Semester:**     | 3rd                                                          |
| **Category:**     | PCC                                                          |
| **Prerequisite:** | Basic computer skills and an understanding of coding concepts. |
| **Rationale:**    | Java is a versatile, general-purpose programming language that is open-source, platform-independent, class-based, and object-oriented, featuring an extensive library ecosystem. It is widely recognized for its simplicity, portability, reliability, and is designed to be robust, secure, dynamic, and architecture-neutral. The "write once, run anywhere" principle allows Java code to run on any platform that supports Java without needing to be recompiled. With strong industry support, Java is essential for many technologies such as Java Server Pages (JSP) and Android app development. This course equips students with the essential skills needed to develop object-oriented applications in Java and will enable them to solve real-world programming challenges. |

A suggestive list of projects/case study is given here. This has to match the COs. Similar projects could be assigned to students by the concerned course teacher:

Case Study 1: Develop a Banking management application that provides following services to customers.

1. Customers can view their account details such as type of account, available balance etc.
2. He/she can perform transactions (i. e. Cash Deposit and Withdraw).

Case  Study  2: Develop  a  simple  college  management  application  that  provides  following services.

1. Stores  Details  of  college,  departments,  and  students  (use  inheritance  to  define  class hierarchy).
2. Shows  exam  results  of  Students  (Result  of  Individual  student,  %pass,  %fail,  top-3 students, etc).

Case Study 3: Develop a library book issue management system.

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student- related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity.

- a) Prepare a document which differentiates Java versions.
- b) Undertake projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Undertake a market survey of different JAVA APIs.
