## 1. Rationale

Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture of
machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate various types
of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental ability which is language
neutral yet requires use of a language for its implementation. As far as data structures are
concerned, the course covers Python dictionaries as well as classes and objects for defining
user defined data types such as linked lists and binary search trees. This course is designed
to develop an integrated ability to efficient software development and apply the knowledge
to various application systems; hence this course is very important for IT diploma engineers.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Implement various types of data structures algorithms using python.

## 3. Course Outcomes
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for theachievement of
the following COs:
a. Understand linear and non-linear data structures.
b. Implement Object Oriented Programming concepts in Python.
c. Implement basic data structures such as stacks, queues and linked lists.
d. Apply Algorithms for solving problems like searching and sorting of data.
e. Implement nonlinear data structures like trees.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.
     a) Work as a leader/a team member.
     b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
     i. ‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
     ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
     iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised
Bloom’s taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If
required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of
COs and competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at
different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above
table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
a. Prepare a practical journal.
b. Undertake micro-projects in teams.
c. Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
d. Prepare a chart to classify Data structures.
e. Explore different python data structure modules.
11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
a. Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various
topics/subtopics.
b. Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
c. ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
d. About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
e. With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
f. Guide students for finding suitable data structures to solve given problems.
12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project

Data Structure with Python                                                        Course Code: 4331601

are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

```
which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a
dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a
seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be
about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The
students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-
oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

      a) Phone directory application using doubly-linked lists- This project can demonstrate
         the working of contact book applications and also teach you about data structures
         like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Typically, phone book management
         encompasses searching, sorting, and deleting operations. A distinctive feature of the
         search queries here is that the user sees suggestions from the contact list after
         entering each character.
      b) Hangman Game: The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of
         secret words. A random word (Eg. a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and
         the player gets limited chances to win the game. When a letter in that word is
         guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all
         letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
      c) Stack and queue implementation using linked list: Develop a python program that
         implements stack and queue operations using linked list representation.
