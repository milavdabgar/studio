  "rationale": "Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate various types of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its implementation. As far as data structures are concerned, the course covers Python dictionaries as well as classes and objects for defining user defined data types such as linked lists and binary search trees. This course is designed to develop an integrated ability to efficient software development and apply the knowledge to various application systems; hence this course is very important for IT diploma engineers.",
