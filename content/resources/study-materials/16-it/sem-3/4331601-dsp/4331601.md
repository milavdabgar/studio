## 1. RATIONALE

Development  of  application  systems  and  software  that  use  underlying  architecture  of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate various types of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its implementation. As far as data structures are concerned, the course covers Python dictionaries as well as classes and objects for defining user defined data types such as linked lists and binary search trees.  This course is designed to develop an integrated ability to efficient software development and apply the knowledge to various application systems; hence this course is very important for IT diploma engineers.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

## ‚óè Implement various types of data structures algorithms using python.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for theachievement of the following COs:

- a) Understand linear and non-linear data structures.
- b) Implement Object Oriented Programming concepts in Python.
- c) Implement basic data structures such as stacks, queues and linked lists.
- d) Apply Algorithms for solving problems like searching and sorting of data.
- e) Implement nonlinear data structures like trees.

## Note

- i. More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a suggestive list .
- ii. The  following  are  some sample 'Process'  and  'Product'  related  skills(more  may  be added/deleted depending on the course)that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises of this course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

## 6. MAJOR EQUIPMENT/ INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED

These major equipment with broad specifications for the PrOs is a guide to procure them by the administrators to usher in uniformity of practicals in all institutions across the state.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above  mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this course competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

The  major  underpinning  theory  is  given  below  based  on  the  higher  level  UOs  of  Revised Bloom's  taxonomy  that  are  formulated  for  development  of  the  COs  and  competency.  If required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions  to  assess  the  attainment  of  the  UOs.  The  actual  distribution  of  marks  at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare a practical journal.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Prepare a chart to classify Data structures.
- e) Explore different python data structure modules.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- f) Guide students for finding suitable data structures to solve given problems.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project

are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three .

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated  work  diary  consisting  of  individual  contributions  in  the  project  work  and  give  a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-16  (fourteen  to  sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industryoriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Phone directory application using doubly-linked listsThis project can demonstrate the working of contact book applications and also teach you about data structures like  arrays,  linked  lists,  stacks,  and  queues.  Typically,  phone  book  management encompasses searching, sorting, and deleting operations. A distinctive feature of the search  queries  here  is  that  the  user  sees  suggestions  from  the  contact  list  after entering each character.
- b) Hangman Game: The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. A random word (Eg. a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the  player  gets  limited  chances  to  win  the  game.  When  a  letter  in  that  word  is guessed  correctly,  that  letter  position  in  the  word  is  made  visible.  In  this  way,  all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
- c) Stack and queue implementation using linked list: Develop a python program that implements stack and queue operations using linked list representation.
