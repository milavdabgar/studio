## 1. RATIONALE

Development  of  application  systems  and  software  that  use  underlying  architecture  of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate various types of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its implementation. As far as data structures are concerned, the course covers Python dictionaries as well as classes and objects for defining user defined data types such as linked lists and binary search trees.  This course is designed to develop an integrated ability to efficient software development and apply the knowledge to various application systems; hence this course is very important for IT diploma engineers.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

**Implement various types of data structures algorithms using python.**

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of the following COs:

- a) Understand linear and non-linear data structures.
- b) Implement Object Oriented Programming concepts in Python.
- c) Implement basic data structures such as stacks, queues and linked lists.
- d) Apply Algorithms for solving problems like searching and sorting of data.
- e) Implement nonlinear data structures like trees.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare a practical journal.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Prepare a chart to classify Data structures.
- e) Explore different python data structure modules.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- f) Guide students for finding suitable data structures to solve given problems.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) **Phone directory application using doubly-linked lists** - This project can demonstrate the working of contact book applications and also teach you about data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues. Typically, phone book management encompasses searching, sorting, and deleting operations. A distinctive feature of the search queries here is that the user sees suggestions from the contact list after entering each character.
- b) **Hangman Game** - The Hangman program randomly selects a secret word from a list of secret words. A random word (Eg. a fruit name) is picked up from our collection and the player gets limited chances to win the game. When a letter in that word is guessed correctly, that letter position in the word is made visible. In this way, all letters of the word are to be guessed before all the chances are over.
- c) **Stack and queue implementation using linked list** - Develop a python program that implements stack and queue operations using linked list representation.
