  "rationale": "Understanding cryptography and web security is essential in today's digital landscape, where the protection of sensitive information is the main goal. It is the backbone of secure communication, financial transactions and data integrity across the internet. Incorporating cryptography fosters a culture of security awareness, essential for protecting information in our increasingly connected world. The subject Cryptography and Web Security aims to equip students with the foundational knowledge and practical skills required to understand and apply key security principles. The students will explore essential cryptographic algorithms: symmetric and asymmetric, and study their applications in real-world scenarios. The course also covers critical web security protocols including SSL, HTTPS, and firewall mechanisms, enabling students to understand vulnerabilities and secure online systems. Through Python-based programming implementations, students will gain hands-on experience in developing simple cryptographic solutions, thereby enhancing their analytical, problem-solving, and technical skills. This subject lays a strong foundation for advanced studies and careers in cyber security, ethical hacking, and secure software development.",
