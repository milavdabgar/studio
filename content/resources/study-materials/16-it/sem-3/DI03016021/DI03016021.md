| **Prerequisite:** | Basic knowledge of computer networks, website and Internet, Basic mathematical concepts and modular arithmetic. |
| **Rationale:**    | Understanding cryptography and web security is essential in today's digital landscape, where the protection of sensitive information is the main goal. It is the backbone of secure communication, financial transactions and data integrity across the internet. Incorporating cryptography fosters a culture of security awareness, essential for protecting information in our increasingly connected world. The subject Cryptography and Web Security aims to equip students with the foundational knowledge and practical skills required to understand and apply key security principles. The students will explore essential cryptographic algorithms: symmetric and asymmetric, and study their applications in real-world scenarios. The course also covers critical web security protocols including SSL, HTTPS, and firewall mechanisms, enabling students to understand vulnerabilities and secure online systems. Through Python-based programming implementations, students will gain hands-on experience in developing simple cryptographic solutions, thereby enhancing their analytical, problem-solving, and technical skills. This subject lays a strong foundation for advanced studies and careers in cyber security, ethical hacking, and secure software development. |

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student- related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this  course:  Students  should  perform  following  activities  in  group  and  prepare  reports  of  about  5 pages  for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their  (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

* a) Organize or attend workshops and training sessions on topics like ethical hacking, penetration testing.
* b) Assign any tool for website vulnerability testing like Nessus, Nmap etc. and generate report on it.
* c) Study any password cracking tool and try it on sample document. For example, John the ripper
* d) Check the strength of your windows system password using L0phtCrack tool.
* e) Use Cryptool 2.1 tool for various cryptographic techniques.
