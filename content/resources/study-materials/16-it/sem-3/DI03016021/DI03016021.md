Understanding cryptography and web security is essential in today's digital
landscape, where the protection of sensitive information is the main goal. It is the
backbone of secure communication, financial transactions and data integrity across
the internet. Incorporating cryptography fosters a culture of security awareness,
essential for protecting information in our increasingly connected world. The
subject Cryptography and Web Security aims to equip students with the
foundational knowledge and practical skills required to understand and apply key
security principles.
The students will explore essential cryptographic algorithms: symmetric and
Rationale:
asymmetric, and study their applications in real-world scenarios. The course also
covers critical web security protocols including SSL, HTTPS, and firewall
mechanisms, enabling students to understand vulnerabilities and secure online
systems.
Through Python-based programming implementations, students will gain hands-on
experience in developing simple cryptographic solutions, thereby enhancing their
analytical, problem-solving, and technical skills. This subject lays a strong
foundation for advanced studies and careers in cyber security, ethical hacking, and
secure software development.

Course Outcome:
After the completion of the course, the student will be able to:
