W. e. f. Academic Year:                 2024-25
Semester:                               3rd
Category of the Course:                 PCC

Prerequisite:    Students should have basic computer knowledge, programming basics.
The Operating Systems course is a fundamental component of Computer Science
and Information Technology curricula. An operating system (OS) serves as the
backbone of any computing environment, managing hardware resources, enabling
software applications, and providing a user-friendly interface. Understanding the
principles of operating systems is essential for students aiming to pursue careers in
software development, system administration, cyber security, and cloud computing.
This course provides students with in-depth knowledge of OS concepts, including
Rationale:
process management, memory allocation and file systems. Students will gain
practical experience in system operations and troubleshooting. The course also
integrates hands-on lab exercises and projects to reinforce theoretical concepts
through practical implementation.
By the end of this course, students will develop a strong foundation in operating
system design, functionality, and optimization, preparing them for advanced studies
in system architecture, embedded systems, and distributed computing.

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:
No                                 Course Outcomes                                      RBT Level
