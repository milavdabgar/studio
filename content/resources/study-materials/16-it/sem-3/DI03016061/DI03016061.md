| **Prerequisite:** | Students should have basic computer knowledge, programming basics. |
| **Rationale:**    | The Operating Systems course is a fundamental component of Computer Science and Information Technology curricula. An operating system (OS) serves as the backbone of any computing environment, managing hardware resources, enabling software applications, and providing a user-friendly interface. Understanding the principles of operating systems is essential for students aiming to pursue careers in software development, system administration, cyber security, and cloud computing. This course provides students with in-depth knowledge of OS concepts, including process management, memory allocation and file systems. Students will gain practical experience in system operations and troubleshooting. The course also integrates hands-on lab exercises and projects to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical implementation. By the end of this course, students will develop a strong foundation in operating system design, functionality, and optimization, preparing them for advanced studies in system architecture, embedded systems, and distributed computing. |

## Course Outcome

After completion of the course, student will be able to:

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  student-related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their  (student's)  portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews. Following is the list of proposed student activities like:

- a) Prepare report on Android Operating System.
- b) Compare file operations of Windows and Linux Operating System.
- c) Case study on MacOs.
- d) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to learn various topics/sub topics.
