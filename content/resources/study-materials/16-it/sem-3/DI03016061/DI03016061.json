  "rationale": "The Operating Systems course is a fundamental component of Computer Science and Information Technology curricula. An operating system (OS) serves as the backbone of any computing environment, managing hardware resources, enabling software applications, and providing a user-friendly interface. Understanding the principles of operating systems is essential for students aiming to pursue careers in software development, system administration, cyber security, and cloud computing. This course provides students with in-depth knowledge of OS concepts, including process management, memory allocation and file systems. Students will gain practical experience in system operations and troubleshooting. The course also integrates hands-on lab exercises and projects to reinforce theoretical concepts through practical implementation. By the end of this course, students will develop a strong foundation in operating system design, functionality, and optimization, preparing them for advanced studies in system architecture, embedded systems, and distributed computing.",
