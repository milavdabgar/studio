| **Dirty Read** | Reading uncommitted data |
| **Non-repeatable Read** | Different values read in same transaction |
| **Phantom Read** | New rows appear between reads |

**Example 1 - Lost Update**:

```
T1: Read(A=100)
T2: Read(A=100)  
T1: A = A + 50 (A=150)
T2: A = A + 30 (A=130) <- Lost T1's update
T1: Write(A=150)
T2: Write(A=130) <- Final value wrong
```

**Example 2 - Dirty Read**:

```
T1: Write(A=200) [Not committed]
T2: Read(A=200)  <- Dirty read
T1: Rollback     <- A back to original
T2: Continues with wrong value
```

**Mnemonic:** "LDNP - Lost Dirty Non-repeatable Phantom"
