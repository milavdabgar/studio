- Student_Name depends only on Student_ID (partial dependency)
- Course_Name and Instructor depend only on Course_ID

**After 2NF:**

**Student Table:**

| Student_ID | Student_Name |
|------------|--------------|
| 101 | John |
| 102 | Mary |

**Course Table:**

| Course_ID | Course_Name | Instructor |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| C1 | DBMS | Dr. Smith |
| C2 | Java | Dr. Jones |

**Enrollment Table:**

| Student_ID | Course_ID |
|------------|-----------|
| 101 | C1 |
| 101 | C2 |
| 102 | C1 |

| **Finding Min/Max** | MIN()/MAX() | Highest salary per department |

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) as Total_Students, AVG(Marks) as Avg_Marks
FROM Student 
GROUP BY Department;
```

**Result:**

| Department | Total_Students | Avg_Marks |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| IT | 25 | 78.5 |
| CS | 30 | 82.1 |

- **Groups**: Creates separate groups for each department
- **Aggregates**: Calculates count and average for each group

**Mnemonic:** "GROUP BY creates Summary Reports"

## Question 4(b) OR [4 marks]

**Describe Set Operators in SQL with example**

**Answer**:

**Set Operators**: Combine results from two or more SELECT statements.

**Table: SQL Set Operators**

| Operator | Description | Requirement | Example |
|----------|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **UNION** | Combines results, removes duplicates | Same column structure | SELECT name FROM students UNION SELECT name FROM teachers |
| **UNION ALL** | Combines results, keeps duplicates | Same column structure | SELECT name FROM students UNION ALL SELECT name FROM alumni |
| **INTERSECT** | Returns common records | Same column structure | SELECT course FROM current_courses INTERSECT SELECT course FROM popular_courses |
| **MINUS** | Records in first query but not second | Same column structure | SELECT student_id FROM enrolled MINUS SELECT student_id FROM graduated |

**Example:**

```sql
-- Students who are also teachers
SELECT name FROM students
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM teachers;

-- All people in university
SELECT name, 'Student' as type FROM students
UNION
SELECT name, 'Teacher' as type FROM teachers;
```

**Rules:**

- **Column Count**: Must be same in all queries
- **Data Types**: Corresponding columns must have compatible types

**Example - Unnormalized Table:**

| Student_ID | Name | Subjects |
|------------|------|----------|
| 101 | John | Math, Science, English |
| 102 | Mary | Science, History |

**Problems:**

- Subjects column contains multiple values
- Difficult to query specific subjects
- Update anomalies when adding/removing subjects

**After 1NF:**

**Student Table:**

| Student_ID | Name |
|------------|------|
| 101 | John |
| 102 | Mary |

**Student_Subject Table:**

| Student_ID | Subject |
|------------|---------|
| 101 | Math |
| 101 | Science |
| 101 | English |
| 102 | Science |
| 102 | History |

**Benefits:**

- **Atomic Values**: Each cell contains single value
- **Flexible Queries**: Easy to find students studying specific subjects
- **Easy Updates**: Add/remove subjects without affecting other data

**Mnemonic:** "1NF = One value per cell, No repeating groups"

## Question 5(a) [3 marks]

**Explain Serializability in Transaction Management**

**Answer**:

**Serializability**: Property that ensures concurrent execution of transactions produces same result as some serial execution of those transactions.

**Table: Types of Serializability**

| Type | Description | Method |
|------|-------------|--------|
| **Conflict Serializability** | Based on conflicting operations | Precedence graph |
| **View Serializability** | Based on read-write patterns | View equivalence |

**Example:**
Transaction T1: R(A), W(A), R(B), W(B)
Transaction T2: R(A), W(A), R(B), W(B)

**Serial Schedule:** T1 → T2 or T2 → T1
**Concurrent Schedule:** Interleaved operations

- **Conflict Operations**: Operations on same data item where at least one is write
- **Serializable Schedule**: Equivalent to some serial schedule
- **Non-serializable**: May lead to inconsistent database state

**Mnemonic:** "Serializability ensures Transaction Consistency"

## Question 5(b) [4 marks]

**Describe Partial Functional Dependency with example**

**Answer**:

**Partial Functional Dependency**: When a non-key attribute is functionally dependent on only part of a composite primary key.

**Table: Functional Dependency Types**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Full Dependency** | Depends on entire primary key | (Student_ID, Course_ID) → Grade |
| **Partial Dependency** | Depends on part of primary key | (Student_ID, Course_ID) → Student_Name |

**Example:**
**Enrollment Table:**
Primary Key: (Student_ID, Course_ID)

| Student_ID | Course_ID | Student_Name | Course_Name | Grade |
|------------|-----------|--------------|-------------|-------|
| 101 | C1 | John | DBMS | A |
| 101 | C2 | John | Java | B |

**Partial Dependencies:**

- Student_ID → Student_Name (Student_Name depends only on Student_ID)
- Course_ID → Course_Name (Course_Name depends only on Course_ID)

**Problems:**

- **Update Anomaly**: Changing student name requires multiple updates
- **Insertion Anomaly**: Cannot add student without enrolling in course
- **Deletion Anomaly**: Deleting enrollment may lose student information

**Solution**: Normalize to 2NF by removing partial dependencies

**Mnemonic:** "Partial dependency = Part of key determines attribute"

## Question 5(c) [7 marks]

**Write a Short note on Locking Mechanism with example in Transaction Management**

**Answer**:

**Locking Mechanism**: Concurrency control technique that prevents simultaneous access to data items during transaction execution.

**Table: Types of Locks**

| Lock Type | Description | Usage |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| **Shared Lock (S)** | Multiple transactions can read | Read operations |
| **Exclusive Lock (X)** | Only one transaction can access | Write operations |
| **Intention Lock** | Indicates intent to lock at lower level | Hierarchical locking |

**Two-Phase Locking (2PL) Protocol:**

1. **Growing Phase**: Acquire locks, cannot release any lock
2. **Shrinking Phase**: Release locks, cannot acquire new locks

**Example:**

```
Transaction T1: Read(A), Write(A), Read(B), Write(B)
Transaction T2: Read(A), Write(A), Read(C), Write(C)

T1: S-lock(A), Read(A), X-lock(A), Write(A), S-lock(B), Read(B), X-lock(B), Write(B), Unlock(A), Unlock(B)
T2: Wait for A, S-lock(A), Read(A), X-lock(A), Write(A), S-lock(C), Read(C), X-lock(C), Write(C), Unlock(A), Unlock(C)
```

**Lock Compatibility Matrix:**

| Current/Requested | S | X |
|------------------|---|---|
| **S** | ✓ | ✗ |
| **X** | ✗ | ✗ |

**Problems:**

- **Deadlock**: Two transactions waiting for each other's locks
- **Starvation**: Transaction waits indefinitely for lock

**Solutions:**

- **Deadlock Detection**: Use wait-for graph
- **Deadlock Prevention**: Timestamp-based protocols

**Mnemonic:** "Locking prevents Concurrent Conflicts"

---

## Question 5(a) OR [3 marks]

**Explain Deadlock in Transaction Management**

**Answer**:

**Deadlock**: Situation where two or more transactions are waiting indefinitely for each other to release locks, creating a circular wait condition.

**Table: Deadlock Components**

| Component | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Mutual Exclusion** | Resources cannot be shared | Exclusive locks |
| **Hold and Wait** | Process holds resources while waiting | T1 holds A, waits for B |
| **No Preemption** | Resources cannot be forcibly taken | Locks cannot be revoked |
| **Circular Wait** | Circular chain of waiting processes | T1→T2→T1 |

**Example:**

```
Transaction T1: Lock(A), Lock(B)
Transaction T2: Lock(B), Lock(A)

Time 1: T1 gets Lock(A)
Time 2: T2 gets Lock(B) 
Time 3: T1 waits for Lock(B) - held by T2
Time 4: T2 waits for Lock(A) - held by T1
Result: DEADLOCK!
```

**Detection**: Use wait-for graph to identify cycles
**Prevention**: Use timestamp ordering or wound-wait protocols

**Mnemonic:** "Deadlock = Circular Waiting for Resources"

## Question 5(b) OR [4 marks]

**Describe Full Functional Dependency with example**

**Answer**:

**Full Functional Dependency**: A non-key attribute is functionally dependent on the entire primary key (not just part of it).

**Table: Dependency Comparison**

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Full Dependency** | Depends on complete primary key | (Student_ID, Course_ID) → Grade |
| **Partial Dependency** | Depends on part of primary key | (Student_ID, Course_ID) → Student_Name |

**Example:**
**Enrollment Table:**
Primary Key: (Student_ID, Course_ID)

| Student_ID | Course_ID | Grade | Hours |
|------------|-----------|-------|--------|
| 101 | C1 | A | 4 |
| 101 | C2 | B | 3 |
| 102 | C1 | B | 4 |

**Full Functional Dependencies:**

- (Student_ID, Course_ID) → Grade ✓
- (Student_ID, Course_ID) → Hours ✓

**Explanation:**

- **Grade** depends on both Student_ID AND Course_ID (specific student in specific course)
- **Hours** also depends on both (student's hours in specific course)
- Cannot determine Grade from Student_ID alone
- Cannot determine Grade from Course_ID alone

**Benefits:**

- **No Update Anomalies**: Changes affect only relevant records
- **Proper Normalization**: Supports 2NF requirements
- **Data Integrity**: Ensures accurate relationships

**Mnemonic:** "Full dependency needs Complete Key"

## Question 5(c) OR [7 marks]

**Explain ACID Properties of Transaction with example**

**Answer**:

**ACID Properties**: Four fundamental properties that guarantee database transaction reliability.

**Table: ACID Properties**

| Property | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Atomicity** | All or nothing execution | Bank transfer: both debit and credit must happen |
| **Consistency** | Database remains in valid state | Account balance cannot be negative |
| **Isolation** | Transactions don't interfere | Concurrent transactions appear sequential |
| **Durability** | Committed changes are permanent | Data survives system crashes |

**Detailed Examples:**

**Atomicity Example:**

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance - 1000 WHERE AccNo = 'A001';
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance + 1000 WHERE AccNo = 'A002';
COMMIT;
```

*If either update fails, entire transaction is rolled back*

**Consistency Example:**

```sql
-- Before: A001 = 5000, A002 = 3000, Total = 8000
-- Transfer 1000 from A001 to A002
-- After: A001 = 4000, A002 = 4000, Total = 8000
-- Total money in system remains constant
```

**Isolation Example:**

```
T1: Read(A=100), A=A+50, Write(A=150)
T2: Read(A=100), A=A*2, Write(A=200)
Serial Result: A=300 or A=250
Isolated execution must produce one of these results
```

**Durability Example:**

```
After COMMIT is executed, even if system crashes,
the transferred amount remains in destination account
```

**Implementation:**

- **Atomicity**: Using transaction logs and rollback
- **Consistency**: Using constraints and triggers
- **Isolation**: Using locking mechanisms
- **Durability**: Using write-ahead logging

**Mnemonic:** "ACID keeps Transactions Reliable"
