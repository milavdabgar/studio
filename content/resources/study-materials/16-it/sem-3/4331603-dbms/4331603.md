Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)
Semester-III

Course Title: Database Management
- Course Code: 4331603)

Diploma programme in which this course is offered             Semester in which offered
Information Technology                                      Third

## 1. Rationale

Database management course introduces students to database design using various models,
- QL commands, techniques and operation. This helps students to design ER-models to
represent simple databases and convert them into relational tables, populate relational
databases and formulate SQL queries on data.Students will improve database design
through normalization. Students will understand how database systems must provide for the
safety of the stored information, despite system crashes or attempts at unauthorized access.
If data are to be shared among several users, the system must avoid possible anomalous
results due to multiple users concurrently accessing the same data.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Design database for a given application.
- Perform various database operations.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:
a)Explain the basic concepts of databases.
b)Design database using Entity relationship approach.
c)Implement Relational algebra in a database.
d)Apply SQL Commands for creating, manipulating and controlling databases.
e)Apply concepts of normalization to design an optimal database.
f)Explain transaction management concepts for concurrent use of database.

         Aim: Normalization of database.
         Consider the following relational schema:
         a)Employee(eid, ename, salary, mngr id, mngrname,
         mngrage,ecity)
         b)Student(no,name, bdate, city, semester, subname, submarks,
         percentage)

         For above schemas, answer the following questions:-
```

- Determine the primary key for given relation.
- Is there any pitfall in design of relation schema? Explain it.
- Find out various dependencies among given attributes of given
relation schema.
- Normalize given relation schema up to possible normal form
Prepare a report on transaction management concepts for

Note
- More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to
develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a
suggestive list.
- The following are some sample ‘Process’ and ‘Product’ related skills (more may be
added/deleted depending on the course) that occur in the above listed Practical Exercises
of this course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency..

## 6. MAJOR EQUIPMENT/ INSTRUMENTS REQUIRED
## Practical Outcomes

These major equipment with broad specifications for the PrOs is a guide to procure them by
the administrators to usher in uniformity of practical in all institutions across the state.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
competency.
       a)Work as a database administrator.
       b)Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

```

## 9. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at
different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above
table.

## 11. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Give a presentation on database case studies.
- Visit a software company and discuss their practices adopted for database development.

- 2. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.

- 3. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a
dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a
seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should
not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student
ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry
orientedCOs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
Students have to perform the following steps for any chosen project.

- Choose any topic of your choice and enlist its requirements.
- Draw an ER Diagram for your chosen topic and prepare tables, establish relationships
          between them.
- Normalize the database.
- Determine the different scenarios and how data will be fetched with queries.
- Write the relational algebra queries for queries mentioned.

Management system, Transportation Management System, Library Management System.
