## 1. RATIONALE

Database management course introduces students to database design using various models, SQL  commands,  techniques  and  operation.  This  helps  students  to  design  ER-models  to represent  simple  databases  and  convert  them  into  relational  tables,  populate  relational databases  and  formulate  SQL  queries  on  data.Students  will  improve  database  design through normalization. Students will understand how database systems must provide for the safety of the stored information, despite system crashes or attempts at unauthorized access. If  data  are  to  be  shared  among  several  users,  the  system  must  avoid  possible  anomalous results due to multiple users concurrently accessing the same data.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

- a. Design database for a given application.
- b. Perform various database operations.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

a)Explain the basic concepts of databases.

b)Design database using Entity relationship approach. c)Implement Relational algebra in a database. d)Apply SQL Commands for creating, manipulating and controlling databases. e)Apply concepts of normalization to design an optimal database. f)Explain transaction management concepts  for concurrent use of database.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above  mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfil  the  development  of  this competency.

a)Work as a database administrator.

b)Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 9. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in  order  development  of  the  COs  and  competency  is  not  missed  out  by  the students  and  teachers.  If  required,  more  such  higher  level  UOs  could  be  included  by  the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist student for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions  assess  the  attainment  of  the  UOs.  The  actual  distribution  of  marks  at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from above table.

## 11. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various  outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Give a presentation on database case studies.
- b) Visit a software company and discuss their practices adopted for database development.

## 12. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive  open  online  courses  ( MOOCs )  may  be  used  to  teach  various  topics/sub topics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using  different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 13. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are  group-based.  However,  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters,  it  should  be  preferably  be individually undertaken  to  build  up  the  skill  and  confidence  in  every  student  to  become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated  work  diary  consisting  of  individual  contributions  in  the  project  work  and  give  a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not  be  less  than 16  (sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The  student ought  to  submit  a  micro-project  by  the  end  of  the  semester  to  develop  the  industry orientedCOs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher: Students have to perform the following steps for any chosen project.

- a) Choose any topic of your choice and enlist its requirements.
- b) Draw an ER Diagram for your chosen topic and prepare tables, establish relationships between them.
- c) Normalize the database.
- d) Determine the different scenarios and how data will be fetched with queries.
- e) Write the relational algebra queries for queries mentioned.

Sample Project Definitions: Hotel management,Event Management,Hospital Management,Health Monitoring Management System, Airline Management, Bank Management system, Transportation Management System, Library Management System.
