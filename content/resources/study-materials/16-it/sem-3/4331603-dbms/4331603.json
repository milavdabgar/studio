  "rationale": "Database management course introduces students to database design using various models, SQL commands, techniques and operation. This helps students to design ER-models to represent simple databases and convert them into relational tables, populate relational databases and formulate SQL queries on data. Students will improve database design through normalization. Students will understand how database systems must provide for the safety of the stored information, despite system crashes or attempts at unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among several users, the system must avoid possible anomalous results due to multiple users concurrently accessing the same data.",
