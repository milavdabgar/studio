Course / Subject Name  :Data Structures with Python

| w. e. f. Academic Year:   | 2024-25   |
|---------------------------|-----------|
| Semester:                 | 3 rd      |
| Category of the Course:   | PCC       |

Prerequisite:

Basic  knowledge  of  Python  (variables,  loops, functions). Familiarity with fundamental programming concepts.

Rationale:

Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate various types of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental ability which  is language  neutral yet requires use of a language  for its implementation. As far as data structures are concerned, the course covers Python dictionaries as well as classes and objects for defining user defined data types such as  linked  lists  and  binary  search  trees.    This  course  is  designed  to  develop  an integrated ability to efficient software development and apply the knowledge to various application systems; hence this course is very important for IT diploma engineers.

## Course Outcome:

After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

## Maze Solver using Breadth-First Search (Queue)

Implement a maze-solving application using BFS, where the maze is represented as a graph. The program finds the shortest path from the entry to the exit, making it useful in robotics and game development.

Course / Subject Name  :Data Structures with Python

## a) File Version Control using Stack

Develop a version control system where each change to a file is stored in a stack (LIFO). Users can revert to previous versions by popping changes from the stack. This mimics how undo/redo functionalities work in text editors and software development tools.

## b) Student Records Management using Binary Search Tree (BST)

This  project  allows  users  to  manage  student  records  efficiently  using  a  BST.  Each  node represents  a  student,  storing  details  like  name,  ID,  and  marks.  The  BST  enables  quick searching, insertion, and deletion of records based on student IDs. Additional features can include sorting students based on marks and displaying the top performers.

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student related co curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in

## this course:

- a) Develop  a  DS-based  Application  -  Build  projects  like  a  contact  book  (linked  lists),  task scheduler (heaps), or inventory system (queues &amp; stacks) using advanced Python concepts.
- b) Explore  Libraries  -  Use  NumPy,  pandas,  or  NetworkX  to  analyze  and  manipulate  data structures efficiently.
- c) API Integration - Fetch and process real-world data (e.g., weather, stock prices) using REST APIs and store them in hash tables or graphs.
- d) Competitive  Coding  -  Solve  data  structure  challenges  on  LeetCode,  HackerRank,  or Codewars to enhance problem-solving skills.
