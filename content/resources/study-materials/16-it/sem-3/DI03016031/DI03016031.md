**Academic Year:** 2024-25

Semester:                              3rd

Category of the Course:                PCC

Prerequisite:      Basic knowledge of Python (variables, loops, functions). Familiarity with
fundamental programming concepts.
Rationale:         Development of application systems and software that use underlying architecture
of machines efficiently and effectively requires the ability to use and manipulate
various types of Data Structures and other constructs. This being a fundamental
ability which is language neutral yet requires use of a language for its
implementation. As far as data structures are concerned, the course covers Python
dictionaries as well as classes and objects for defining user defined data types such
as linked lists and binary search trees. This course is designed to develop an
integrated ability to efficient software development and apply the knowledge to
various application systems; hence this course is very important for IT diploma
engineers.

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

Suggested Project List:
A suggestive list of projects is given here. This has to match the COs. Similar projects could be added
by the concerned course teacher:
Maze Solver using Breadth-First Search (Queue)
Implement a maze-solving application using BFS, where the maze is represented as a graph.
The program finds the shortest path from the entry to the exit, making it useful in robotics
and game development.

- File Version Control using Stack
Develop a version control system where each change to a file is stored in a stack (LIFO).
Users can revert to previous versions by popping changes from the stack. This mimics how
undo/redo functionalities work in text editors and software development tools.
- Student Records Management using Binary Search Tree (BST)
This project allows users to manage student records efficiently using a BST. Each node
represents a student, storing details like name, ID, and marks. The BST enables quick
searching, insertion, and deletion of records based on student IDs. Additional features can
include sorting students based on marks and displaying the top performers.
Suggested Activities for Students:
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student related co
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course:
- Develop a DS-based Application – Build projects like a contact book (linked lists), task
scheduler (heaps), or inventory system (queues & stacks) using advanced Python concepts.
- Explore Libraries – Use NumPy, pandas, or NetworkX to analyze and manipulate data
structures efficiently.
- API Integration – Fetch and process real-world data (e.g., weather, stock prices) using REST
- PIs and store them in hash tables or graphs.
- Competitive Coding – Solve data structure challenges on LeetCode, HackerRank, or
Codewars to enhance problem-solving skills.
