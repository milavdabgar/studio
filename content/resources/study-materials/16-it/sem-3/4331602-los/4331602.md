- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews. Following is the list of proposed student activities like:

- a) Prepare lab report of Practical.
- b) Power Point Presentation.
- c) Case study and Report preparation.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub topics.
- b) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that is to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- c) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning for making presentation, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- d) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.

- e) Concepts should be explained thoroughly in theory sessions and should be implemented in laboratory appropriately along with the problem solving.
- f) Concept should be developed by giving problems to students as assignment.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Prepare a presentation on 'Various Linux distribution' / 'Kali Linux' / 'Linux security'/ 'Mobile Operating System' / 'Kali Linux and Ethical Hacking'
- b) Prepare a presentation on comparative analysis of various process scheduling algorithms based on their scheduling criteria.
- c) Prepare a document of various Linux Networking Commands.
