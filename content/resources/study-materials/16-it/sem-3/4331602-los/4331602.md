## 1. Rationale

An operating system is a program that interacts with the user and the computer hardware
and controls the execution of all kinds of programs. This course makes students to
understand importance of Operating System and Linux distributions, its functionalities to
manage resources, Linux program development and its execution. After learning this course,
students will be able to classify various types of operating systems and made aware of
process and file management with emphasis given to Linux type of Open Source Operating
System and its security features.

## 2. Competency

The course content should be taught and implemented with the aim to develop different
types of skills so that students are able to acquire following competency:
- Perform Linux shell scripts for resource management in Operating System.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the achievement of
the following COs:
- Differentiate various operating systems & explain Linux Operating System.
- Illustrate various aspects of process, process scheduling and deadlock
management.
- Understand various file management and file allocation techniques.
- Justify the need of security and protection mechanism in Operating System.
- Perform various Linux command and develop shell scripts.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
course competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
- Give the presentation to fully understand the topic and listen to others with respect.
- Understand the security and privacy of hardware & software and practice them while
        performing practical.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at
different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above
table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews.
Following is the list of proposed student activities like:
- Prepare lab report of Practical.
- Power Point Presentation.
- Case study and Report preparation.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/sub
topics.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that is to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning for making presentation, but to
be assessed using different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.

- Concepts should be explained thoroughly in theory sessions and should be
implemented in laboratory appropriately along with the problem solving.
- Concept should be developed by giving problems to students as assignment.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

```
which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro project should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Prepare a presentation on “Various Linux distribution” / “Kali Linux” / “Linux
         security”/ “Mobile Operating System” / “Kali Linux and Ethical Hacking”
- Prepare a presentation on comparative analysis of various process scheduling
         algorithms based on their scheduling criteria.
- Prepare a document of various Linux Networking Commands.
