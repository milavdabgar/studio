## Question 2(c) [7 marks]

**Describe the Round Robin algorithm. Calculate the average waiting time & average turn-around time along with Gantt chart for the given data. Consider context switch = 01 ms and quantum time = 04 ms.**

**Answer**:

**Round Robin Algorithm:**
Round Robin is a preemptive scheduling algorithm where each process gets equal CPU time (quantum) in circular manner.

**Given Data:**

- Quantum Time = 4 ms
- Context Switch = 1 ms

| Process | Arrival Time | Burst Time |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| P1 | 0 | 8 |
| P2 | 3 | 3 |
| P3 | 1 | 10 |
| P4 | 4 | 5 |

**Gantt Chart:**

```
0   4  5   8  9  13 14  18 19  22 23  26 27  29
|P1 |CS|P3|CS|P1|CS|P2|CS|P3|CS|P4|CS|P3|CS|P4|
```

**Calculations:**

| Process | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |

## Question 2(b) OR [4 marks]

**What is a deadlock? Explain the necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur.**

**Answer**:

**Deadlock** is a situation where two or more processes are permanently blocked, each waiting for resources held by others.

**Necessary Conditions (Coffman Conditions):**

| Condition | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mutual Exclusion | Resources cannot be shared simultaneously |
| Hold and Wait | Process holds resources while waiting for others |
| No Preemption | Resources cannot be forcibly taken from processes |
| Circular Wait | Circular chain of processes waiting for resources |

**Example Scenario:**

```goat
Process A ----holds----> Resource 1
    |                        ^
    |                        |
    v                        |
waits for              Process B
Resource 2 <---holds----------|
```

**Deadlock Prevention:**

- **Eliminate Mutual Exclusion**: Make resources shareable when possible
- **Prevent Hold and Wait**: Require all resources at once
- **Allow Preemption**: Forcibly take resources when needed
- **Prevent Circular Wait**: Order resources and request in sequence

**Mnemonic:** "MHNC - Mutual exclusion, Hold-wait, No preemption, Circular wait"

## Question 2(c) OR [7 marks]

|   P1   |   P2   |    P3   |   P4   |
```

**Calculations:**

| Process | Start Time | Completion Time | Turnaround Time | Waiting Time |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| P1 | 0 | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| P2 | 7 | 13 | 10 | 4 |
| P3 | 13 | 22 | 17 | 8 |
| P4 | 22 | 26 | 20 | 16 |

**Average Waiting Time = (0 + 4 + 8 + 16) / 4 = 7 ms**
**Average Turnaround Time = (7 + 10 + 17 + 20) / 4 = 13.5 ms**

**Characteristics:**

## Question 5(c) [7 marks]

**Write a shell script to find the sum of all the individual digits in a given 5-digit number.**

**Answer**:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to find sum of digits in a 5-digit number

echo "Enter a 5-digit number:"
read number

# Validate input
if [ ${#number} -ne 5 ] || ! [[ $number =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]; then
    echo "Error: Please enter exactly 5 digits"
    exit 1
fi

sum=0
temp=$number

# Extract and sum each digit
while [ $temp -gt 0 ]; do
    digit=$((temp % 10))    # Get last digit
    sum=$((sum + digit))    # Add to sum
    temp=$((temp / 10))     # Remove last digit
done

echo "Number: $number"
echo "Sum of digits: $sum"

# Display breakdown
echo "Breakdown:"

# Display individual digits
original=$number
echo -n "Digits: "
for ((i=0; i<5; i++)); do
    digit=$((original % 10))
    if [ $i -eq 4 ]; then
        echo -n "$digit"
    else
        echo -n "$digit + "
    fi
    original=$((original / 10))
done | tac
echo " = $sum"
```

**Algorithm Steps:**

- **Input Validation**: Check for exactly 5 digits
- **Digit Extraction**: Use modulo and division operations
- **Sum Calculation**: Add each extracted digit
- **Display Results**: Show breakdown and final sum

**Example Output:**

```
Enter a 5-digit number: 12345
Number: 12345
Sum of digits: 15
Breakdown: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to find sum and average of N numbers

echo "How many numbers do you want to enter?"
read n

# Validate input
if ! [[ $n =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]] || [ $n -le 0 ]; then
    echo "Error: Please enter a positive integer"
    exit 1
fi

sum=0
echo "Enter $n numbers:"

# Read N numbers and calculate sum
for ((i=1; i<=n; i++)); do
    echo -n "Enter number $i: "
    read number
    
    # Validate each number
    if ! [[ $number =~ ^-?[0-9]+([.][0-9]+)?$ ]]; then
        echo "Error: Invalid number format"
        exit 1
    fi
    
    sum=$(echo "$sum + $number" | bc -l)
done

# Calculate average
average=$(echo "scale=2; $sum / $n" | bc -l)

# Display results
