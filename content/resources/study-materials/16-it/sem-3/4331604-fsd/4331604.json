  "rationale": "One of the important product in the field of Information Technology is a Software. The software has changed every aspect of our life and made available everything of our finger tips. It has revolutionize every area of human life like education, health, defense and security, finance and business, travel, social life, politics, entertainment and so on. Thus, a software increases the responsibilities for the developer. The software development process in the industry is also changing rapidly. This course guides the students to analyze, design, implement and test the software product with proper documentation during the courses in higher semesters of diploma programme.",
