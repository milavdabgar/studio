| Principle | Guideline | Limit | Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|
| **File Organization** | One class per file | Related functions grouped | Easy navigation |
| **Function Length** | Keep functions small | 20-30 lines max | Better testing |
| **Class Size** | Single responsibility | Focused purpose | Maintainability |
| **Module Coupling** | Minimize dependencies | Loose coupling | Flexibility |

**(4) Documentation Standards:**

| Type | Format | Content | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Header Comments** | File description | Purpose, author, date | `// Customer management module` |
| **Function Comments** | Parameter description | Input/output specs | `@param userId - unique identifier` |
| **Inline Comments** | Complex logic | Why, not what | `// Using binary search for performance` |
| **API Documentation** | Public interfaces | Usage examples | Method signatures |

**(5) Error Handling:**

| Practice | Description | Example | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Exception Handling** | Use try-catch blocks | `try { ... } catch (Exception e)` | Graceful failure |
| **Error Messages** | Meaningful messages | "Invalid email format" | User guidance |
| **Logging** | Record error details | `log.error("Database connection failed")` | Debugging support |
| **Validation** | Input checking | Check null values | Prevent errors |

**(6) Performance Guidelines:**

| Area | Standard | Example | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Memory Usage** | Avoid memory leaks | Close resources | System stability |
| **Algorithm Choice** | Efficient algorithms | Use appropriate data structures | Response time |
| **Database Access** | Minimize queries | Use connection pooling | Scalability |
| **Code Optimization** | Avoid premature optimization | Profile before optimizing | Maintainability |

**Code Review Standards:**
