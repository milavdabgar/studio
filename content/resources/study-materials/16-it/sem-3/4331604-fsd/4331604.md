## 5. SUGGESTED PRACTICAL EXERCISES

The following practical outcomes (PrOs) are the sub-components of the COs. These PrOs need to be attained to achieve the COs.

To  perform  all  the  practicals  more  effectively,  the  faculty  membersare  advised  to prepare the group of 3-4 students and assign one software project with 3 to 4 modules/major functionalities. Based on that project, the group will perform all the practicals. The example of software  projects  for  practicals:  student  information  system,  attendance  management,  result management,  online  exam,  inventory  control,  payroll  system,  sales  management,  library management, leave management(employee), medical store-shop-any store management, hotel management, patient management, Medical Laboratory Management etc. The project can be any known online or offline information management system.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above  mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfil  the  development  of  this competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in  order  development  of  the  COs  and  competency  is  not  missed  out  by  the studentsand  teachers.  If  required,  more  such  higher  level  UOs  could  be  included  by  the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various  outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- b) Suggest a small existing software/website to students and discuss on betterment of its user-interface design.
- c) Visit  a  software  company  and  observe  their  documents  and  discuss  their  practices adopted for software development.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are  group-based.  However,  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters,  it  should  be  preferably  be individually undertaken  to  build  up  the  skill  and  confidence  in  every  student  to  become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should  not  be  less  than 16  (sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The

student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- 1: Study the SRS document of project from any software company and enlist functional as well as non-functional requirements.
- 2: Prepare classand other UML diagrams of any known system.
- 3: Prepare the user interface using online tools of the known system.
- 4: Search any automated test case generator and prepare test suits for the system.
