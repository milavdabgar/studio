## 1. Rationale

One of the important product in the field of Information Technology is a Software. The
software has changed every aspect of our life and made available everything of our finger
tips. It has revolutionize every area of human life like education, health, defense and
security, finance and business, travel, social life, politics, entertainment and so on. Thus, a
software increases the responsibilities for the developer. The software development process
in the industry is also changing rapidly. This course guides the students to analyze, design,
implement and test the software product with proper documentation during the courses in
higher semesters of diploma programme.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:
- Analyze problems and prepare the software solutionwith documentation.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

At the end of the course, the student will develop adequate skills ofdocumentation and will
understand the application of concepts in software development.

- Explain software development activities.
- Select appropriate software process model for software project development.
- Prepare software requirement specification(SRS) document for a software project.
- Organize software project development schedule.
- Prepare a design of the software with user interface.
- Apply testing on software product with proper test cases.

## Practical Outcomes

```
The following practical outcomes (PrOs) are the sub-components of the COs. These PrOs need to
be attained to achieve the COs.
        To perform all the practicals more effectively, the faculty membersare advised to
prepare the group of 3-4 students and assign one software project with 3 to 4 modules/major
functionalities. Based on that project, the group will perform all the practicals. The example of
software projects for practicals: student information system, attendance management, result
management, online exam, inventory control, payroll system, sales management, library
management, leave management(employee), medical store-shop-any store management, hotel
management, patient management, Medical Laboratory Management etc. The project can be
any known online or offline information management system.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
studentsand teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at
different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the
above table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Suggest a small existing software/website to students and discuss on betterment of
its user-interface design.
- Visit a software company and observe their documents and discuss their practices
adopted for software development.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various
topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and
give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project
should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The

 student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry
 oriented COs.
         A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
     1: Study the SRS document of project from any software company and enlist functional
        as well as non-functional requirements.
     2:Prepare classand other UML diagrams of any known system.
     3: Prepare the user interface using online tools of the known system.
     4: Search any automated test case generator and prepare test suits for the system.
