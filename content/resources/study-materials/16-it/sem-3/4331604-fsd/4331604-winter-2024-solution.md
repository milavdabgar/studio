**Temporal Cohesion:**

- **Time-based** relationship
- **Example**: System startup or shutdown routines
- **Moderate quality** design

**Logical Cohesion:**

- **Similar functions** grouped together
- **Example**: All mathematical functions in one module
- **Poor design** - difficult to maintain

**Coincidental Cohesion (Worst):**

- **No logical relationship** between elements
- **Example**: Miscellaneous utility functions
- **Avoid this** - creates maintenance nightmares

**Benefits of High Cohesion:**

- **Easier maintenance** and debugging
- **Better reusability** of modules
- **Improved testability** and reliability
- **Clearer code** understanding

**How to Achieve High Cohesion:**
