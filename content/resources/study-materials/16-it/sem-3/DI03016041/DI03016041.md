While no formal prerequisites are strictly required to learn Database Management
Prerequisite:    Systems (DBMS), having a foundational understanding of basic computer concepts,
and perhaps some programming experience, can be beneficial.
Database management course introduces students to database design using various
models, SQL commands, techniques, and operation. This helps students to design
- R-models to represent simple databases and convert them into relational tables,
populate relational databases and formulate SQL queries on data. Students will
Rationale:       improve database design through normalization. Students will understand how
database systems must provide for the safety of the stored information, despite
system crashes or attempts at unauthorized access. If data are to be shared among
several users, the system must avoid possible anomalous results due to multiple
users concurrently accessing the same data.

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:
No                                         Course Outcomes                                   RBT Level
