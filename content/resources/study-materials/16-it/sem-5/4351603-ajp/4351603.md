## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this competency.

- a) Work as a Java developer.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

**Legends:** R = Remember, U = Understand, A = Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Explore different application development using java web application technologies/tools and frameworks.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- f) Guide students for open source java editors.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that he/she contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- **Project idea 1: Degree/Diploma Admission Web Application** - Develop Degree/Diploma Admission web application using java web application technologies to get student registration data, process and filter data<br>- Verification of submitted data<br>- Support files/documents uploading features
- **Project idea 2: Library Management System** - Develop Library Management System<br>- To update the record, monitor and add books<br>- Search for the required ones, taking care of the issue date and return date<br>- It comes with basic features like creating a new record and updating and deleting it
- **Project idea 3: College Placement Record Keeping System** - Develop MVC based web application for college placement record keeping<br>- Student registration, apply for company<br>- Find the result of the interview
