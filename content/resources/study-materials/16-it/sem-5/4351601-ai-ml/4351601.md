Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Explore different data repositories and register for ML based competitions on platforms like
kaggle.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Collect data from snapchat/ facebook and do sentiment analysis using NLP.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by
teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to
be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment
methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for open source python editors.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be
assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-
project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably
be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
 maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and
 give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project
 should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The
 student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry
 oriented COs.
          A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Project idea 1: Credit Scoring System: Student can use neural networks to develop an
    intelligent credit scoring system for the banks. Loan defaulters and fraudulent entities are
    required to be managed to avoid financial losses. Neural networks can be exceptionally
    useful in developing smart alternatives to traditional credit scoring systems.
- Project idea 2: Sentiment analysis: Businesses use it to track client product feedback,
    making it popular. If most reviews are positive, the companies are on the right course.
    Moreover, if the majority of evaluations generated by this NLP Project are deficient, the
    corporation can make efforts to improve the product.
- Project idea 3: Conversational Bots: ChatBots, most tech companies today use Chatbots,
    which are conversational bots, to communicate with their consumers and handle issues.
    It is an excellent method for both customers and businesses to save time.
