Information Technology                               5th Semester

## 1. Rationale

In this course students will learn about types of networks, protocols, and essential
addressing systems (Subnetting and supernetting). It covers the basic underlying concepts
and techniques recently used in the IT industry. The course will cover various aspects of
mobile computing and networks, including the fundamental concepts of mobile devices,
wireless communication technologies. In today's digital age, mobile computing has become
an essential component of our daily lives. People rely on mobile devices to access
information, communicate with others, and conduct business transactions. Therefore, the
course will equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to manage mobile
computing and networks effectively. Furthermore, the course will also provide students with
a basic understanding of the latest trends and developments in mobile computing and
networks, including emerging technologies such as 5G and 6G.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching-learning experiences:

- Use the latest mobile technology to manage networks.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge, and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

The student will develop underpinning knowledge, adequate programming skills of
competency for implementing various applications using python programming language to
attain the following course outcomes.

- Differentiate OSI and TCP/IP models.

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
competencies.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- List different types of Network operating system.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Identify the type of Network in your Institute.
- Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam,
edx, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various
topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.

- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed four.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
 maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and
 give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project
 should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The
 student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry
 oriented COs.
         A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Build a network simulation to create virtual networks, configure devices (routers,
        switches, etc.), and simulate data transmission using OSI or TCP/IP protocols. Users
        should be able to observe the flow of packets through different layers and analyze
        network performance. (Use cisco packet tracer or wireshark)
- Case study on any one layer of OSI model.
- Case study on different types of Network devices available at each layer.
- Case study on IPv4 Address scheme with subnetting and supernetting. (Faculty can
        give a network to design in which student has to use subnetting and supernetting)
- Create a simulation of Mobile IP, a protocol that allows mobile devices to maintain
        continuous connectivity as they move between different networks. The project will
        involve implementing key components of Mobile IP and demonstrating its
        functionality in a simulated network environment. [Use NS-3 (Network Simulator 3)
        or OMNeT++]
- Conduct a comparative analysis of TCP's performance over various mobile networks,
        including 3G, 4G (LTE), and 5G. Measure and compare TCP performance metrics such
        as throughput, latency, and packet loss across these networks. Identify the
        differences and similarities in TCP behavior and evaluate the challenges specific to
- CP over 3G.
- Presentation on different WLAN standards.
- Present different WPAN standards.
- Case study on GSM architecture.
- Case study on 4G architecture.
