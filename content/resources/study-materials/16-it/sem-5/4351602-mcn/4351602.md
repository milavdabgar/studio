- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) List different types of Network operating system.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Identify the type of Network in your Institute.
- e) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed four.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- **Network Simulation Project** - Build a network simulation to create virtual networks, configure devices (routers, switches, etc.), and simulate data transmission using OSI or TCP/IP protocols. Users should be able to observe the flow of packets through different layers and analyze network performance. (Use cisco packet tracer or wireshark)
- **OSI Model Case Study** - Case study on any one layer of OSI model
- **Network Devices Case Study** - Case study on different types of Network devices available at each layer
- **IPv4 Address Scheme Case Study** - Case study on IPv4 Address scheme with subnetting and supernetting (Faculty can give a network to design in which student has to use subnetting and supernetting)
- **Mobile IP Simulation** - Create a simulation of Mobile IP, a protocol that allows mobile devices to maintain continuous connectivity as they move between different networks. The project will involve implementing key components of Mobile IP and demonstrating its functionality in a simulated network environment. [Use NS-3 (Network Simulator 3) or OMNeT++]
- **TCP Performance Analysis** - Conduct a comparative analysis of TCP's performance over various mobile networks, including 3G, 4G (LTE), and 5G. Measure and compare TCP performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and packet loss across these networks. Identify the differences and similarities in TCP behavior and evaluate the challenges specific to TCP over 3G
- **WLAN Standards Presentation** - Presentation on different WLAN standards
- **WPAN Standards Presentation** - Present different WPAN standards
- **GSM Architecture Case Study** - Case study on GSM architecture
- **4G Architecture Case Study** - Case study on 4G architecture
