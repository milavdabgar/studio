## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this competencies.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through  the laboratory/field based  exercises.  Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only  the  major  Underpinning  Theory  is  formulated  as  higher-level  UOs  of Revised  Bloom's taxonomy in  order  development  of  the  COs  and  competency  is  not  missed  out  by  the students  and  teachers.  If  required,  more  such  higher-level  UOs  could  be  included  by  the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions  assess  the  attainment  of  the  UOs.  The  actual  distribution  of  marks  at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various  outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) List different types of Network operating system.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Identify the type of Network in your Institute.
- e) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.

- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are  group-based.  However,  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters,  it  should  be  preferably  be individually undertaken  to  build  up  the  skill  and  confidence  in  every  student  to  become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed four.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should  not  be  less  than 16  (sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Build  a  network  simulation  to  create  virtual  networks,  configure  devices  (routers, switches, etc.), and simulate data transmission using OSI or TCP/IP protocols. Users should be able to observe the flow of packets through different layers and analyze network performance. (Use cisco packet tracer or wireshark)
- Case study on any one layer of OSI model.
- Case study on different types of Network devices available at each layer.
- Case study on IPv4 Address scheme with subnetting and supernetting. (Faculty can give a network to design in which student has to use  subnetting and supernetting)
- Create a simulation of Mobile IP, a protocol that allows mobile devices to maintain continuous connectivity as they move between different networks. The project will involve implementing key components of Mobile IP and demonstrating its functionality in a simulated network environment. [Use NS-3 (Network Simulator 3) or OMNeT++]
- Conduct a comparative analysis of TCP's performance over various mobile networks, including 3G, 4G (LTE), and 5G. Measure and compare TCP performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and packet loss across these networks. Identify the differences  and  similarities  in  TCP  behavior  and  evaluate  the  challenges  specific  to TCP over 3G.
- Presentation on different WLAN standards.
- Present different WPAN standards.
- Case study on GSM architecture.
- Case study on 4G architecture.
