  "rationale": "In this course students will learn about types of networks, protocols, and essential addressing systems (Subnetting and supernetting). It covers the basic underlying concepts and techniques recently used in the IT industry. The course will cover various aspects of mobile computing and networks, including the fundamental concepts of mobile devices, wireless communication technologies. In today's digital age, mobile computing has become an essential component of our daily lives. People rely on mobile devices to access information, communicate with others, and conduct business transactions. Therefore, the course will equip students with the necessary skills and knowledge to manage mobile computing and networks effectively. Furthermore, the course will also provide students with a basic understanding of the latest trends and developments in mobile computing and networks, including emerging technologies such as 5G and 6G.",
