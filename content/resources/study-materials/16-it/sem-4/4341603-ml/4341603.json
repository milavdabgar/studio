  "rationale": "Machine learning focuses on the use of data and algorithms to perform learning similar to the way human learns. To solve recent problems in IT domain it is important to understand the need of machine learning and apply machine learning methods in efficient ways. Every student of Information Technology must therefore understand the blue prints of machine learning approaches and must be able to apply learning methods on available datasets. This course will help students to build up core competencies in understanding machine learning approaches and students will be able to design and train machine learning modes for various use cases.",
