Diploma programme in which this course is offered                       Semester in which offered

Information Technology                                      4th semester

## 1. Rationale

Machine learning focuses on the use of data and algorithms to perform learning similar to
the way human learns. To solve recent problems in IT domain it is important to understand
the need of machine learning and apply machine learning methods in efficient ways. Every
student of Information Technology must therefore understand the blue prints of machine
learning approaches and must be able to apply learning methods on available datasets. This
course will help students to build up core competencies in understanding machine learning
approaches and students will be able to design and train machine learning modes for various
use cases.
## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching-learning experiences:
- Develop appropriate machine learning algorithms for problem solving

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge, and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

The student will develop underpinning knowledge, adequate programming skills of
competency for implementing various applications using python programming language to
attain the following course outcomes.

- To understand the need of machine learning for various problem solving.
- Prepare machine leaning model and learning the evaluation methods.
- Evaluate various supervised learning algorithms using appropriate dataset.
- Evaluate various unsupervised learning algorithms using appropriate dataset.
- To understand the use of various existing machine learning libraries.

level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year

## 9. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the
above table.

## 11. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Explore different data repositories and register for ML based competitions on
platforms like kaggle.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Collect various sensor data from smart phones and apply machine learning approach.

- 2. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various
topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for open source python editors.

- 3. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
 maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and
 give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project
 should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The
 student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry
 oriented COs.
         A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Project idea 1: BigMart Sales Prediction: BigMart sales dataset consists of 2013 sales
        data for 1559 products across 10 different outlets in different cities. The goal of the
        BigMart sales prediction ML project is to build a regression model to predict the sales
        of each of 1559 products for the following year in each of the 10 different BigMart
        outlets.
- Project idea 2: Stock Price Prediction using machine learning is the process of
        predicting the future value of a stock traded on a stock exchange for reaping profits.
        With multiple factors involved in predicting stock prices, it is challenging to predict
        stock prices with high accuracy, and this is where machine learning plays a vital role.
- Project idea 3: Data from leading music service can be taken to build a better music
        recommendation system.
