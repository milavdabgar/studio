## 1. RATIONALE

Machine learning focuses on the use of data and algorithms to perform learning similar to the way human learns. To solve recent problems in IT domain it is important to understand the need of machine learning and apply machine learning methods in efficient ways. Every student of Information Technology must therefore understand the blue prints of machine learning approaches and must be able to apply learning methods on available datasets. This course will help students to build up core competencies in understanding machine learning approaches and students will be able to design and train machine learning modes for various use cases.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences:

## ‚óè Develop appropriate machine learning algorithms for problem solving

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge, and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

The student will develop underpinning knowledge, adequate  programming  skills of competency for implementing various applications using python programming language to attain the following course outcomes.

- a) To understand the need of machine learning for various problem solving.
- b) Prepare machine leaning model and learning the evaluation methods.
- c) Evaluate various supervised learning algorithms using appropriate dataset.
- d) Evaluate various unsupervised learning algorithms using appropriate dataset.
- e) To understand the use of various existing machine learning libraries.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above-mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfill  the  development  of  this competency.

- a) Work as a Data scientist.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 9. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in  order  development  of  the  COs  and  competency  is  not  missed  out  by  the students  and  teachers.  If  required,  more  such  higher-level  UOs  could  be  included  by  the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test

items/questions  assess  the  attainment  of  the  UOs.  The  actual  distribution  of  marks  at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary  slightly from the above table.

## 11. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various  outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Explore  different  data  repositories  and  register  for  ML  based  competitions  on platforms like kaggle.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Collect various sensor data from smart phones and apply machine learning approach.

## 12. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- f) Guide students for open source python editors.

## 13. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are  group-based.  However,  in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters,  it  should  be  preferably  be individually undertaken  to  build  up  the  skill  and  confidence  in  every  student  to  become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshopbased, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs  which  are  in  fact,  an  integration  of  PrOs,  UOs  and  ADOs.  Each  student  will  have  to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should  not  be  less  than 16  (sixteen)  student  engagement  hours during  the  course.  The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Project idea 1: BigMart Sales Prediction: BigMart sales dataset consists of 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 different outlets in different cities. The goal of the BigMart sales prediction ML project is to build a regression model to predict the sales of each of 1559 products for the following year in each of the 10 different BigMart outlets.
- Project  idea  2: Stock  Price  Prediction using  machine  learning is  the  process  of predicting the future value of a stock traded on a stock exchange for reaping profits. With multiple factors involved in predicting stock prices, it is challenging to predict stock prices with high accuracy, and this is where machine learning plays a vital role.
- Project idea 3: Data from leading music service can be taken to build a better music recommendation system.
