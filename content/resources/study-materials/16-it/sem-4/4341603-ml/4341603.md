**Legends:** R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Explore different data repositories and register for ML based competitions on platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Collect various sensor data from smart phones and apply machine learning approach.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- f) Guide students for open source python editors.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- **Project idea 1:** BigMart Sales Prediction: BigMart sales dataset consists of 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 different outlets in different cities. The goal of the BigMart sales prediction ML project is to build a regression model to predict the sales of each of 1559 products for the following year in each of the 10 different BigMart outlets.
- **Project idea 2:** Stock Price Prediction using machine learning is the process of predicting the future value of a stock traded on a stock exchange for reaping profits. With multiple factors involved in predicting stock prices, it is challenging to predict stock prices with high accuracy, and this is where machine learning plays a vital role.
- **Project idea 3:** Data from leading music service can be taken to build a better music recommendation system.
