- i) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure the creation of opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- j) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her at the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based (groups of 3 to 5). However, in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters ,  the  number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application-based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs, and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a  dated  work  diary  consisting  of  individual  contributions  to  the  project  work  and  give  a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total  workload on each student due to the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly to the competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Prepare a report on Tools to Analyze Digital Marketing Competitors
- b) Perform analysis of Visual Keyword Tools for Search Engine Marketing
- c) Design Social Media  Strategies for Online Shopping Carts using remarketing techniques
- d) Create SEO friendly Blog on any topic or product

- h) Design  a  website,  host  it  on  a  free  server,  measure  page  views,  visitors,  repeat visitors, bounce rate, etc., and prepare reports.
