## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, the following are the suggested studentrelated co-curricular activities  that  can be  undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct the following activities in groups and prepare short reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro projects, the report should be as per the suggested format, for other activities students and teachers together can decide the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical  evidence

such  as  photographs/videos  of  the  activities  for  their  (student's)  portfolio  which  will  be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- b) Prepare charts to explain the use/process of the identified topic.
- c) Students  are  encouraged  to  prepare  infographics,  posters,  certificates,  or  banners  for promoting college activities and events.
- d) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as Swayam, edx, Coursera,  Udemy,  etc.  to  further  enhance  their  learning  and  to  do  the  certification course on Digital Marketing.
- e) Students  are  encouraged  to  make  a  blog  or  any  social  media  page  of  their  college  or department to promote the events.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) Managing Learning Environment
- d) Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help students.
- e) Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the course material at their pace.
- f) Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be enhanced.
- g) 'CI' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- h) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning but  to  be  assessed  using  different assessment methods.
- i) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure the creation of opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- j) Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the knowledge of this course

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her at the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based (groups of 3 to 5). However, in  the  fifth  and  sixth  semesters ,  the  number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application-based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs, and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a  dated  work  diary  consisting  of  individual  contributions  to  the  project  work  and  give  a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total  workload on each student due to the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly to the competency of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Prepare a report on Tools to Analyze Digital Marketing Competitors
- b) Perform analysis of Visual Keyword Tools for Search Engine Marketing
- c) Design Social Media  Strategies for Online Shopping Carts using remarketing techniques
- d) Create SEO friendly Blog on any topic or product
- e) Prepare a case study on Search Engine marketing techniques
- f) Prepare SEO study of various websites.
- g) Prepare a small website for an event at your institute, analyze users' behavior and prepare statistical reports.
