## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, the following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities that can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct the following activities in groups
and prepare short reports (of 1 to 5 pages for each activity). For micro projects, the report
should be as per the suggested format, for other activities students and teachers together
can decide the format of the report. Students should also collect/record physical evidence

Essentials of Digital Marketing                                                  Course Code: 4341601

such as photographs/videos of the activities for their (student’s) portfolio which will be
useful for their placement interviews:
- Undertake micro-projects in teams.
- Prepare charts to explain the use/process of the identified topic.
- Students are encouraged to prepare infographics, posters, certificates, or banners for
promoting college activities and events.
- Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as Swayam, edx,
Coursera, Udemy, etc. to further enhance their learning and to do the certification
course on Digital Marketing.
- Students are encouraged to make a blog or any social media page of their college or
department to promote the events.

## 11. Suggested Special Instructional Strategies

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- Managing Learning Environment
- Diagnosing Essential Missed Learning concepts that will help students.
- Guide Students to do Personalized learning so that students can understand the course material
at their pace.
- Encourage students to do Group learning by sharing so that teaching can easily be enhanced.
- ‘CI” in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature
is to be given to the students for self-learning but to be assessed using different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure the creation of opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students on how to address issues on environment and sustainability using the
knowledge of this course

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her at the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group-based (groups of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application-based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs, and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions to the project work and give a
seminar presentation of it before submission. The total workload on each student due to
the micro-project should be about 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours (i.e., about one
hour per week) during the course. The students ought to submit a micro-project by the end
of the semester (so that they develop the industry-oriented COs).
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This should relate highly to the competency
of the course and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course
teacher:
