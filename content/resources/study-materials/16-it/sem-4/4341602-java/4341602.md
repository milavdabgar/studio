## 1. RATIONALE

Java  is  a  general-purpose  computer  programming  language;  it  is  platform  independent, open-source,  class-based,  and  object-oriented  with  enriched  open  source  libraries.  It  is  a simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture neutral, object oriented programming language. It has idealized 'virtual machine' that allows application developers 'write once, run anywhere", meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. In the current industrial scenario Java has the broad industry support and prerequisite to many technologies like Java Server Pages, and  Android  Application  Development.  This  course  develops  necessary  skills  in  students, after learning this course; students will be able to develop object oriented applications using java.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences:

- Develop a program using object oriented programming concepts with java to solve the given problems.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The student will develop underpinning knowledge,  adequate  programming  skills of competency for implementing various applications using object oriented programming with java to attain the following course outcomes.

- Understand OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts with java.
- Understand building blocks of OOPs language, inheritance, package and interfaces.
- Implement exception handling and multithreading in object oriented programs.
- Develop an object oriented program handling a Text file.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in  order  development  of  the  COs  and  competency  is  not  missed  out  by  the students  and  teachers.  If  required,  more  such  higher-level  UOs  could  be  included  by  the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare a report based on practical performed in the laboratory.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that is to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- f) Guide students for open source editors.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

**Case Study 1:** Develop a Banking management application that provides following services to customers.

1. Customers can view their account details such as type of account, available balance etc.
2. He/she can perform transactions (i.e. Cash Deposit and Withdraw).

**Case Study 2:** Develop a simple college management application that provides following services.

1. Stores Details of college, departments, and students (use inheritance to define class hierarchy).
2. Shows exam results of Students (Result of Individual student, %pass, %fail, top3 students, etc).

**Case Study 3:** Develop a library book issue management system.
