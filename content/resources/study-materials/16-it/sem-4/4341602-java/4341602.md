Competency-focused Outcome-based Green Curriculum-2021 (COGC-2021)
Semester -IV

Course Title: Object Oriented Programming with JAVA
- Course Code: 4341602)

Diploma programme in which this course is offered             Semester in which offered
Information Technology                                  4th Semester

## 1. Rationale

Java is a general-purpose computer programming language; it is platform independent,
open-source, class-based, and object-oriented with enriched open source libraries. It is a
simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture neutral, object oriented
programming language. It has idealized ‘virtual machine’ that allows application developers
“write once, run anywhere", meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that
support Java without the need for recompilation. In the current industrial scenario Java has
the broad industry support and prerequisite to many technologies like Java Server Pages,
and Android Application Development. This course develops necessary skills in students,
after learning this course; students will be able to develop object oriented applications using
java.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching-learning experiences:
- Develop a program using object oriented programming concepts with java to solve
the given problems.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The student will develop underpinning knowledge, adequate programming skills of
competency for implementing various applications using object oriented programming with
java to attain the following course outcomes.
- Understand OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts with java.
- Understand building blocks of OOPs language, inheritance, package and interfaces.
- Implement exception handling and multithreading in object oriented programs.
- Develop an object oriented program handling a Text file.

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
  above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
  competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.
  The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
  level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
  should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
      ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
      iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at
different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the
above table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare a report based on practical performed in the laboratory.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various
topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that is to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for open source editors.

- 3. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and
give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project
should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The

student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry
oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
Case Study 1: Develop a Banking management application that provides following services to
customers.
```

1. Customers can view their account details such as type of account, available
balance etc.
2. He/she can perform transactions (i. e. Cash Deposit and Withdraw).
Case Study 2: Develop a simple college management application that provides following
services.
1. Stores Details of college, departments, and students (use inheritance to define
class hierarchy).
2. Shows exam results of Students (Result of Individual student, %pass, %fail, top-
3 students, etc).

Case Study 3: Develop a library book issue management system.
