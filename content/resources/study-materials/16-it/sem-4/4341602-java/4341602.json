  "rationale": "Java is a general-purpose computer programming language; it is platform independent, open-source, class-based, and object-oriented with enriched open source libraries. It is a simple, portable, distributive, robust, secure, dynamic, architecture neutral, object oriented programming language. It has idealized 'virtual machine' that allows application developers 'write once, run anywhere', meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. In the current industrial scenario Java has the broad industry support and prerequisite to many technologies like Java Server Pages, and Android Application Development. This course develops necessary skills in students, after learning this course; students will be able to develop object oriented applications using java.",
