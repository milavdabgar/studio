Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Note : The UOs need to be formulated at the 'Application Level' and above of Revised Bloom's Taxonomy' to accelerate the attainment of the COs and the competency.

Legends: R=Remember,  U=Understand,  A=Apply  and  above  (Revised  Bloom's  taxonomy) Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student- related co-curricular activities  which  can  be  undertaken  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the  various outcomes  in  this  course:  Students  should  conduct  following  activities  in  group  and  prepare reports  of  about  5  pages  for  each  activity,  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- Explore different application development using different cloud domains.
- Undertake  micro-projects  in  teams ‚óè Give  a  seminar  on  any  relevant topics.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Page 7 of 10

- Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics. ‚óè Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using  different assessment methods.
- With  respect  to section  No.10 ,  teachers  need  to  ensure  to  create  opportunities  and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- Guide students for various components of cloud platforms.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her  in  the  beginning  of  the  semester.  In  the  first  four  semesters,  the  micro-project  are groupbased. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that he/she contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop- based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work  diary  consisting  of  individual  contributions  in  the  project  work  and  give  a  seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry- oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Host a static website using AWS or any other clouds.
- Create a cloud-based web/mobile application.
- Prepare the report on case study of Amazon Cloud Services/Google Cloud.
