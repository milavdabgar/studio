## 1. Rationale

This course provides the knowledge necessary for cloud computing and data center technologies
offer a range of benefits, including virtualization, security, and global reach. These factors make
them essential components of modern IT infrastructure and enable businesses to adapt to rapidly
evolving technological landscapes. After going through these course students will be able to
understand cloud models, implement security, create a data center, implement virtualization,
use cloud storage and Database service, and understand and implement emerging technologies
with Cloud Computing.

```
    above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
    competency.
- Work as a Cloud developer, Cloud architect or Cloud Engineer.
- Follow ethical practices.

    The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level
    of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should
    gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year ii. ‘Organization
          Level’ in 2nd year.
          iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students
and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher
to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Note: The UOs need to be formulated at the ‘Application Level’ and above of Revised Bloom’s
Taxonomy’ to accelerate the attainment of the COs and the competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions
assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels
(of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student- related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare
reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their
(student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Explore different application development using different cloud domains.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams ● Give a seminar on any relevant
topics.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:

Cloud and Data Center Technologies                                                               Course Code: 4361602

- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature
is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different
assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for various components of cloud platforms.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are
groupbased. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so
that he/she contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have
to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop- based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which
## Practical Outcomes

```
    are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated
    work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar
    presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less
    than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a
    micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry- oriented COs.
            A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and
   the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- Host a static website using AWS or any other clouds.
- Create a cloud-based web/mobile application.
- Prepare the report on case study of Amazon Cloud Services/Google Cloud.
