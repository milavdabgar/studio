## Question 5(c) OR [7 marks]

**What is Virtual Machines? Explain Steps to Create and manage Virtual machines.**

**Answer**:

**Virtual Machine (VM)** is a software-based emulation of a physical computer that runs an operating system and applications in an isolated environment.

**VM Components:**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Virtual CPU** | Emulated processor cores |
| **Virtual Memory** | Allocated RAM for VM |
| **Virtual Storage** | Virtual hard disks |
| **Virtual Network** | Network interface emulation |

**Steps to Create Virtual Machine:**

**1. Planning Phase:**

- **Resource Assessment:** Determine CPU, RAM, storage requirements
- **OS Selection:** Choose guest operating system
- **Network Configuration:** Plan IP addressing and connectivity

**2. VM Creation Process:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Select Hypervisor] --> B[Create VM]
    B --> C[Allocate Resources]
    C --> D[Install OS]
    D --> E[Configure Network]
    E --> F[Install Applications]
```

**3. Detailed Creation Steps:**

| Step | Action | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| **1** | **Create VM Container** | Define VM name and location |
| **2** | **Allocate CPU** | Assign virtual processor cores |
| **3** | **Assign Memory** | Allocate RAM (2GB-16GB typical) |
| **4** | **Create Storage** | Set up virtual hard disk |
| **5** | **Network Setup** | Configure virtual network adapter |
| **6** | **OS Installation** | Install guest operating system |

**VM Management Operations:**

**Power Management:**

- **Start/Stop:** Control VM power state
- **Suspend/Resume:** Pause and resume VM execution
- **Reset:** Force restart VM

**Resource Management:**

- **Hot-add CPU/Memory:** Add resources without shutdown
- **Storage Expansion:** Increase disk capacity
- **Network Reconfiguration:** Modify network settings

**Maintenance Operations:**

| Operation | Purpose | Frequency |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Snapshots** | Point-in-time backup | Before major changes |
| **Cloning** | Create identical copies | For scaling/testing |
| **Migration** | Move VM between hosts | For maintenance |
| **Backup** | Data protection | Daily/Weekly |

**VM Lifecycle Management:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Create VM] --> B[Configure VM]
    B --> C[Deploy Applications]
    C --> D[Monitor Performance]
    D --> E{Maintenance Needed?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Update/Patch]
    E -->|No| D
    F --> G{End of Life?}
    G -->|No| D
    G -->|Yes| H[Decommission VM]
```

**Best Practices:**

- **Regular backups** and snapshot management
- **Resource monitoring** for optimization
- **Security patching** and updates
- **Performance tuning** based on workload

**Monitoring and Troubleshooting:**

- **Performance metrics:** CPU, memory, disk I/O
- **Event logs:** System and application events
- **Network connectivity:** Ping, traceroute tests
- **Resource utilization:** Capacity planning

**VM Security:**

- **Guest OS hardening:** Remove unnecessary services
- **Network isolation:** VLAN segmentation
- **Access control:** User authentication
- **Antivirus protection:** Malware scanning

**Mnemonic:** "CVMN" - CPU, Virtual memory, Network, Storage
