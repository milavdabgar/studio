# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy application code
COPY . .

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Start command
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

**2. Build Docker Image**:

```bash
# Build image from Dockerfile
docker build -t my-web-app:latest .

# List images
docker images
```

**3. Run Docker Container**:

```bash
# Run container with port mapping
docker run -d -p 8080:3000 --name web-app my-web-app:latest

# Check running containers
docker ps
```

**4. Container Management**:

| Command | Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **docker ps** | List running containers | `docker ps -a` |
| **docker stop** | Stop container | `docker stop web-app` |
| **docker start** | Start stopped container | `docker start web-app` |
| **docker logs** | View container logs | `docker logs web-app` |
| **docker exec** | Execute command in container | `docker exec -it web-app /bin/sh` |

**Container Benefits**:

- **Portability**: Run anywhere Docker is installed
- **Consistency**: Same environment across development/production
- **Isolation**: Applications run independently
- **Efficiency**: Share OS kernel, lightweight compared to VMs
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling with orchestration

**Docker vs VM Comparison**:

```goat
    Docker Containers              Virtual Machines
    +-------------------+          +-------------------+
    |   App A   App B   |          |   App A   App B   |
    |  Runtime Runtime  |          |   OS A    OS B    |
    +-------------------+          +-------------------+
    |   Docker Engine   |          |    Hypervisor     |
    +-------------------+          +-------------------+
    |    Host OS        |          |     Host OS       |
    +-------------------+          +-------------------+
    |    Hardware       |          |     Hardware      |
    +-------------------+          +-------------------+
```

**Common Docker Commands**:

- **Image Management**: `docker pull`, `docker push`, `docker rmi`
- **Container Operations**: `docker create`, `docker kill`, `docker rm`
- **System Info**: `docker info`, `docker version`, `docker system df`

**Example Use Case**:
A web application with Node.js backend can be containerized to ensure consistent deployment across development, testing, and production environments, eliminating "works on my machine" issues.

**Container Orchestration**:
For production deployments, use orchestration tools like:

- **Kubernetes**: Advanced container orchestration
- **Docker Swarm**: Native Docker clustering
- **Amazon ECS**: AWS container service
