  "rationale": "Application of Blockchain is vast in nature and is adapted in industries including finance, healthcare, supply chain management, and real estate. Foundation of Blockchain course introduces principles of cryptography and basic concepts of cryptography and applies in Blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Understanding the concept of cryptography will help to move smoothly to the fundamentals of the Blockchain and distributed ledger systems. This course focuses on the building blocks of Blockchain: Blockchain data structure, Blockchain types, block rewards, Consensus mechanisms and distributed ledger and user identification. These concepts help understand conceptualization of Blockchain in the application of cryptocurrency.",
