**Mnemonic**: "Pre-Prepare-Commit" (3 Phases of PBFT)

## Question 4(c) OR [7 marks]

**"Eventual consistency is evident in the context of bitcoin." Justify the given statement.**

**Answer**:

**Definition**: Eventual consistency means the system will become consistent over time, even if it's temporarily inconsistent.

**Bitcoin Implementation**:

**Table: Bitcoin Consistency Mechanisms**

| Mechanism | Description | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Chain Reorganization** | Replace shorter chain with longer | Maintain consensus |
| **Confirmation Delays** | Wait for multiple blocks | Increase certainty |
| **Fork Resolution** | Longest chain wins | Resolve conflicts |

**Scenarios Demonstrating Eventual Consistency**:

1. **Temporary Forks**: When two miners find blocks simultaneously
2. **Network Partitions**: Isolated nodes may have different views
3. **Double Spending Attempts**: Conflicting transactions in different blocks

**Resolution Process**:

- **Mining Continues**: Miners build on their preferred chain
- **Longest Chain Rule**: Network adopts chain with most work
- **Automatic Convergence**: All nodes eventually agree

**Diagram: Fork Resolution**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Block N] --> B[Block N+1a]
    A --> C[Block N+1b]
    B --> D[Block N+2a]
    C --> E[Dies - Shorter Chain]
    D --> F[Becomes Main Chain]
```

**Justification Points**:

- **Probabilistic Finality**: Longer confirmation time = higher certainty
- **No Immediate Consistency**: New transactions aren't instantly final
- **Convergence Guarantee**: Network will eventually agree on single chain
- **Time-based Resolution**: Consistency improves with time

**Practical Implications**:

- **Merchant Waiting**: Wait for confirmations before accepting payment
- **Exchange Policies**: Different confirmation requirements for different amounts
- **Risk Management**: Balance speed vs security based on transaction value

**Mnemonic**: "Time-Brings-Consistency" (Eventual Consistency = Time + Convergence)
