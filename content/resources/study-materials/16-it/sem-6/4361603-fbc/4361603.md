Diploma programme in which this course is offered                   Semester in which offered
Information Technology                                    Sixth

## 1. Rationale
Application of Blockchain is vast in nature and is adapted in industries including finance,
healthcare, supply chain management, and real estate. Foundation of Blockchain course
introduces principles of cryptography and basic concepts of cryptography and applies in
Blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Understanding the concept of cryptography will
help to move smoothly to the fundamentals of the Blockchain and distributed ledger systems.
This course focuses on the building blocks of Blockchain: Blockchain data structure, Blockchain
types, block rewards, Consensus mechanisms and distributed ledger and user identification.
These concepts help understand conceptualization of Blockchain in the application of
cryptocurrency.

## 2. Competency
The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences:

Understand the Blockchain and its building blocks to develop a distributed ledger system
and cryptocurrency.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs):
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:
- Understand concepts of cryptography, Blockchain and distributed ledger.
- Categorize Blockchain structure and Blockchain types.
- Examine Consensus mechanism and attack types in Blockchain.
- Apply concepts of cryptography and Blockchain in cryptocurrency.
- Understand decentralization with the help of Blockchain.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
 above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
 competency.
- Follow ethical practices.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
 The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the
 level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
 should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year ii.
- Organization Level’ in 2nd year. iii.
- Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

```

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students
and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher
to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different
taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related
co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare
reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidence for their
(student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews: a) Give a presentation
on relevant topics.
- Visit a relevant company and discuss their practices adopted for development.
- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed
by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to
him/her at the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is
group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should preferably be individually
undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so
that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In situations where groups are formed
for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed four. The
microproject could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratorybased, or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

```
 which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a
 dated work diary consisting of individual contributions to the project work and give a seminar
 presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be
 less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to
 submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
 A suggested list of micro-projects is given here. This must match the competency and the COs.
 Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

 Sample1: Do a feasibility analysis on Vote chain – Electronic Voting System based on
 Blockchain and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.
 Sample2: Do a feasibility analysis on Transparent and Genuine Charity Applications based on
 Sample3: Do a feasibility analysis on Identifying fake products through a barcode based
 Blockchain system and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.
 Sample4: Do a feasibility analysis on Blockchain-based Land Registries System and prepare a
