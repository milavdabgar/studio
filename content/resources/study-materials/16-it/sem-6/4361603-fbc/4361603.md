## 1. RATIONALE

Application of Blockchain is vast in nature and is adapted in industries including finance, healthcare, supply chain management, and real estate. Foundation of Blockchain course introduces principles of cryptography and basic concepts of cryptography and applies in Blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Understanding the concept of cryptography will help to move smoothly to the fundamentals of the Blockchain and distributed ledger systems. This course focuses on the building blocks of Blockchain: Blockchain data structure, Blockchain types, block rewards, Consensus mechanisms and distributed ledger and user identification. These concepts help understand conceptualization of Blockchain in the application of cryptocurrency.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

- Understand the Blockchain and its building blocks to develop a distributed ledger system and cryptocurrency.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidence for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Give a presentation on relevant topics.
- b) Visit a relevant company and discuss their practices adopted for development.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her at the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In situations where groups are formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed four.

The microproject could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based, or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions to the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggested list of micro-projects is given here. This must match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

**Sample 1:** Do a feasibility analysis on Vote chain - Electronic Voting System based on Blockchain and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.

**Sample 2:** Do a feasibility analysis on Transparent and Genuine Charity Applications based on Blockchain and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.

**Sample 3:** Do a feasibility analysis on Identifying fake products through a barcode based Blockchain system and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.

**Sample 4:** Do a feasibility analysis on Blockchain-based Land Registries System and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.
