## 1. RATIONALE:

Application  of  Blockchain  is  vast  in  nature  and  is  adapted  in  industries  including  finance, healthcare,  supply  chain  management,  and  real  estate.  Foundation  of  Blockchain  course introduces  principles  of  cryptography  and  basic  concepts  of  cryptography  and  applies  in Blockchain and distributed ledger technology. Understanding the concept of cryptography will help to move smoothly to the fundamentals of the Blockchain and distributed ledger systems. This course focuses on the building blocks of Blockchain: Blockchain data structure, Blockchain types, block rewards, Consensus mechanisms and distributed ledger and user identification. These  concepts  help  understand  conceptualization  of  Blockchain  in  the  application  of cryptocurrency.

## 2. COMPETENCY:

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching learning experiences:

- Understand the Blockchain and its building blocks to develop a distributed ledger system and cryptocurrency.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs):

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this competency.

- a) Follow ethical practices.
- b) Work as a leader/a team member.

The  ADOs are  best  developed through  the  laboratory/field-based  exercises.  Moreover,  the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year ii.
2. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year. iii.
3. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only  the  major  Underpinning  Theory  is  formulated  as  higher  level  UOs  of Revised  Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of COs and competency.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports  of  about  5  pages  for  each  activity,  also  collect/record  physical  evidence  for  their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:  a) Give a presentation on relevant topics.

b) Visit a relevant company and discuss their practices adopted for development.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  is  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning ,  but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her at the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project is group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry.  In situations where groups are formed for  micro-projects,  the  number  of  students  in  the  group  should not  exceed  four. The microproject could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratorybased,  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions to the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggested list of micro-projects is given here. This must match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

Sample1: Do  a  feasibility  analysis  on  Vote  chain  -  Electronic  Voting  System  based  on Blockchain and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.

Sample2: Do a feasibility analysis on Transparent and Genuine Charity Applications based on Blockchain and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.

Sample3: Do  a  feasibility  analysis  on  Identifying  fake  products  through  a  barcode  based Blockchain system and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.

Sample4: Do a feasibility analysis on Blockchain-based Land Registries System and prepare a detailed plan to create the system.
