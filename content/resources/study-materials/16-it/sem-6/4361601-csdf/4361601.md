## 1. Rationale

Cyber security and digital forensics are two essential disciplines in the field of information technology.
Cyber Security and Digital Forensics is essential to address the critical shortage of professionals in these
fields. This curriculum equips students with the knowledge and skills needed to protect sensitive data,
understand the legal and ethical aspects of digital investigations, and pursue diverse career opportunities
in information security and digital forensics. Furthermore, it contributes to national security by preparing
professionals to defend critical digital infrastructure and fosters adaptability to emerging threats and
technologies in the ever-evolving digital landscape.

This curriculum ensures that graduates are not only technically proficient but also ethically responsible
professionals who can play a crucial role in protecting digital assets, solving digital crimes, and contributing
to the broader field of information technology and security.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency
through various teaching-learning experiences:

- Enhance knowledge of the latest cyber security threats, attacks, crimes and technologies for
prevent them.
- Demonstrate advanced practical skills in hacking tools and cybercrime investigation.

## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this competency.
- Work as a leader/team member.
- Follow ethical practices for cyber security

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field-based exercises. Moreover, the level of
achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’ should gradually increase
as planned below:

‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year ii. ‘Organization
Level’ in 2nd year. iii.
- Characterization Level’ in 3rd year

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to
teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs.
The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary
slightly from the above table.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related cocurricular
activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:
Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each
activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their
placement interviews:
- Start or join a cyber security club or team on your campus.
- Undertake hacking and cybercrime investigation assignments/micro-projects in teams.
- Organize or attend workshops and training sessions on topics like ethical hacking, penetration
testing, cybercrime and digital forensics.
- Invite industry professionals and experts to give talks and presentations on the latest trends and
best practices in cyber security and digital forensics.
- Visit your nearest Gujarat government cybercrime department and learn how investigate
cybercrime.
- Organize campaigns to promote cyber security awareness and best practices on your campus.
- Identify the vulnerable points for attacks in simple networks in your college and college
websites/government websites.
- Collect and analyze information regarding various types of cyber-attacks and cyber fraud and
provide solution to prevent it
- Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx, Coursera,
Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.

## 11. Suggested Special Instructional Strategies

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various
outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to
develop the outcomes.

Cyber Security and Digital Forensic                                                          Course Code: 4361601

- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given
to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-
curricular activities.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a students that needs to be assigned to them in the
beginning of the semester. The number of students in the group should not exceed three. The microproject
could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop based, incident based, laboratorybased or
field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of

```
PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual
contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total
duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the
course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-
oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar
micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
Idea 1:Anomaly Detection System: Build an anomaly-based DDoS detection system that establishes a
baseline of normal network behaviour and identifies deviations from this baseline as potential attacks. This
could involve statistical analysis or machine learning techniques.
Idea 2:Credit Card Fraud Detection System: Develop an intelligent credit card fraud detection system that
combines various techniques and technologies to identify and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions
in real-time. The system should be able to distinguish between legitimate transactions and unauthorized
or fraudulent activities.
Idea 3:Create a Case Study:Ask students to analyze a genuine or hypothetical legal case that involves digital
evidence and require them to create a comprehensive report or presentation focusing on the various
aspects of digital forensics within the case.
Idea 4: Network traffic logs analysis:Provide network traffic logs for analysis by students to detect any
potentially suspicious or malicious activities, including unauthorized access or data exfiltration.
Idea 5:Basic mobile forensic analysis: Students should be guided to perform a mobile forensic analysis,
which involves extracting deleted text messages, phone records, and other digital evidence.
Idea 6: Network Scanning & Vulnerability Assessment: Prepare report and suggest ways to secure local
area network or WLAN of institute.
Idea 7: Identify web application is vulnerable to something like SQL injection or XSS and suggest ways to
protect it.
Idea 8: Use ethical hacking to break passwords.
