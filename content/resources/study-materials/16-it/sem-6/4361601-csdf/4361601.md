## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Start or join a cyber security club or team on your campus.
- b) Undertake hacking and cybercrime investigation assignments/micro-projects in teams.
- c) Organize or attend workshops and training sessions on topics like ethical hacking, penetration testing, cybercrime and digital forensics.
- d) Invite industry professionals and experts to give talks and presentations on the latest trends and best practices in cyber security and digital forensics.
- e) Visit your nearest Gujarat government cybercrime department and learn how to investigate cybercrime.
- f) Organize campaigns to promote cyber security awareness and best practices on your campus.
- g) Identify the vulnerable points for attacks in simple networks in your college and college websites/government websites.
- h) Collect and analyze information regarding various types of cyber-attacks and cyber fraud and provide solution to prevent it
- i) Students are encouraged to register themselves in various MOOCs such as: Swayam, edx, Coursera, Udemy etc to further enhance their learning.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to them in the beginning of the semester. The number of students in the group should not exceed three. The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop based, incident based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

**Idea 1: Anomaly Detection System:** Build an anomaly-based DDoS detection system that establishes a baseline of normal network behaviour and identifies deviations from this baseline as potential attacks. This could involve statistical analysis or machine learning techniques.

**Idea 2: Credit Card Fraud Detection System:** Develop an intelligent credit card fraud detection system that combines various techniques and technologies to identify and prevent fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time. The system should be able to distinguish between legitimate transactions and unauthorized or fraudulent activities.

**Idea 3: Create a Case Study:** Ask students to analyze a genuine or hypothetical legal case that involves digital evidence and require them to create a comprehensive report or presentation focusing on the various aspects of digital forensics within the case.

**Idea 4: Network traffic logs analysis:** Provide network traffic logs for analysis by students to detect any potentially suspicious or malicious activities, including unauthorized access or data exfiltration.

**Idea 5: Basic mobile forensic analysis:** Students should be guided to perform a mobile forensic analysis, which involves extracting deleted text messages, phone records, and other digital evidence.

**Idea 6: Network Scanning & Vulnerability Assessment:** Prepare report and suggest ways to secure local area network or WLAN of institute.

**Idea 7:** Identify web application is vulnerable to something like SQL injection or XSS and suggest ways to protect it.

**Idea 8:** Use ethical hacking to break passwords.
