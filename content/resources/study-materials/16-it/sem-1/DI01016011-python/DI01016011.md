| **Prerequisite:** | Basic computer skills, including the ability to write basic statements and expressions. |
| **Rationale:** | Computer programming skills are now becoming part of basic education as these skills are increasing of vital importance for future job and career prospects. The Python programming language is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. The course emphasizes the use of python programming in multiple domains. Python is a modern language for writing compact codes specifically for programming Server-side web apps, Data Analytics and Machine Learning, an important Artificial Intelligence domain. Furthermore, Python has gained popularity in scientific computing, production tools and game programming. This course focuses on developing python programming to do a variety of programming tasks where the students are encouraged to develop basic applications using different open source tools. At the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic programming skills using python language. |

### Note

More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a suggestive list.

## List of Laboratory/Learning Resources Required

| Sr. No. | Laboratory/Learning Resources/Equipment Name with Broad Specifications | PrO. No. |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| 1 | Computer system with operating system: Windows 7 or higher Ver., macOS, and Linux, with 4GB or higher RAM, Python versions: 2.7.X, 3.6.X, or higher Ver. | All |
| 2 | Python IDEs and Code Editors - Open Source: IDLE, Jupyter | 2 to 14 |

## Suggested Project List

Only one project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. The project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the project should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit projects by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of projects is given here. This has to match the COs. Similar projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. Develop a console based application to convert number systems (i.e., Binary to Decimal, Binary to Octal, etc.)
2. Develop a simple calculator.
3. Develop console based Countdown timer.
4. Print number system table for given range (Decimal | Binary | Octal | Hexadecimal)
5. Develop a fizz-buzz game.
6. Develop a program to generate random passwords (8 Digits).

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

a) Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
b) Undertake projects in teams
c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
d) Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.
