**Academic Year:** 2024-2025
Semester:                         1st
Category of the Course:           PCC

Prerequisite:     Basic computer skills, including the ability to write basic statements and
expressions.
Rationale:        Computer programming skills are now becoming part of basic education as these
skills are increasing of vital importance for future job and career prospects. The
Python programming language is one of the most popular programming
languages worldwide. The course emphasizes the use of python programming in
multiple domains. Python is a modern language for writing compact codes
specifically for programming Server-side web apps, Data Analytics and Machine
Learning, an important Artificial Intelligence domain. Furthermore, Python has
gained popularity in scientific computing, production tools and game
programming.
This course focuses on developing python programming to do a variety of
programming tasks where the students are encouraged to develop basic
applications using different open source tools. At the end of the course, the
student will be developing adequate basic programming skills using python
language.

Course Outcome:
After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

Suggested Project List:
Only one project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the
beginning of the semester. The project could be industry application based, internet-based,
workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

```
which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated
work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation
of it before submission. The duration of the project should be about 14- 16 (fourteen to sixteen)
student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit projects by the end of the
semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of projects is given here. This has to match the COs. Similar projects could be
added by the concerned course teacher:
     1) Develop a console based application to convert number systems(i.e. . Binary to Decimal,
         Binary to Octal, etc.)
     2) Develop a simple calculator.
     3) Develop console based Countdown timer.
     4) Print number system table for given range.(Decimal | Binary | Octal | Hexadecimal)
     5) Develop a fizz-buzz game.
     6) Develop a program to generate random passwords (8 Digits.).

Suggested Activities for Students:
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student- related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5
pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s)
portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
- Undertake projects in teams
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.
