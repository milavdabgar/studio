| Rationale:      | Computer programming skills are now becoming part of basic education as these  skills are increasing of vital importance for future job and career prospects. The  Python  programming  language  is  one  of  the  most  popular  programming  languages worldwide. The course emphasizes the use of python programming in  multiple  domains.  Python  is  a  modern  language  for  writing  compact  codes  specifically for programming Server-side web apps, Data Analytics and Machine  Learning, an important  Artificial  Intelligence  domain.  Furthermore,  Python has  gained  popularity  in  scientific  computing,  production  tools  and  game  programming.   This  course  focuses  on  developing  python  programming  to  do  a  variety  of  programming  tasks  where  the  students  are  encouraged  to  develop  basic  applications  using  different  open  source  tools.  At  the  end  of  the  course,  the  student  will  be  developing  adequate  basic  programming  skills  using  python  language. |

## Course Outcome:

After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:

Note :-

More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a suggestive list.

## Suggested Project List:

Only one project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning  of  the  semester.  The  project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of  it  before  submission.  The  duration  of  the  project  should  be  about  14-  16  (fourteen  to  sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit projects by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list  of  projects  is  given  here.  This  has  to  match  the  COs.  Similar  projects  could  be added by the concerned course teacher:

- 1) Develop a console based application to convert number systems(i.e. . Binary to Decimal, Binary to Octal, etc.)
- 2) Develop a simple calculator.
- 3) Develop console based Countdown timer.
- 4) Print number system table for given range.(Decimal | Binary | Octal | Hexadecimal)
- 5) Develop a fizz-buzz game.
- 6) Develop a program to generate random passwords (8 Digits.).

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student- related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this  course:  Students  should  perform  following  activities  in  group  and  prepare  reports  of  about  5 pages  for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their  (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
- b) Undertake projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.
