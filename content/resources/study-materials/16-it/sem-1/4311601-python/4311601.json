  "rationale": "Computer programming skills are now becoming part of basic education as these skills are increasing of vital importance for future job and career prospects. The Python programming language is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. The course emphasizes the use of python programming in multiple domains. Python is a modern language useful for writing compact codes specifically for programming in the area of Server-side Web development, Data Analytics, AI, and scientific computing as well as production tools and game programming. This course focuses on developing python programming to do a variety of programming tasks where the students are encouraged to develop basic applications using different open source tools. At the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic programming skills using python language.",
