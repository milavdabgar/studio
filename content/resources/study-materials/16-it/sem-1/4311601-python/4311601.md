## 1. Rationale

Computer programming skills are now becoming part of basic education as these skills are
increasing of vital importance for future job and career prospects. The Python programming
language is one of the most popular programming languages worldwide. The course
emphasizes the use of python programming in multiple domains. Python is a modern
language useful for writing compact codes specifically for programming in the area of Server-
side Web development, Data Analytics, AI, and scientific computing as well as production
tools and game programming.
This course focuses on developing python programming to do a variety of programming
tasks where the students are encouraged to develop basic applications using different open
source tools. At the end of the course, the student will be developing adequate basic
programming skills using python language.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching learning experiences.

- Develop a program using Python language to solve the given problem.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the following Course
Outcomes (COs) achievement :

- Prepare flowchart and algorithm for solving computing problems.
- Develop python programs to solve simple problems.
- Apply control structure feature of python for developing programs.
- Develop a program in Python using built-in functions, modules, and library functions.
- Develop python programs applying strings and lists manipulation concepts.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
course competency.
- Follow safety practices.
- Practice good housekeeping.
- Demonstrate working as a leader/a team member.
- Maintain tools and equipment
- Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

The major underpinning theory is given below based on the higher level UOs of Revised
Bloom’s taxonomy that are formulated for development of the COs and competency. If
required, more such UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on attainment of

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at
different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the

various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various
topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for open source python editors.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs

which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Case Study 1: Compare three various tools functionality for python programming
       development.
- Case Study 2: List out new features of python 3.9 version and compare with older
       two different versions.
- Case Study 3: Study math module of python and explain real life usage with
       examples.
