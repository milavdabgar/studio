## 1. RATIONALE

Computer programming skills are now becoming part of basic education as these skills are increasing of vital importance for future job and career prospects. The Python programming language  is  one  of  the  most  popular  programming  languages  worldwide.  The  course emphasizes  the  use  of  python  programming  in  multiple  domains.  Python  is  a  modern language useful for writing compact codes specifically for programming in the area of Serverside  Web development, Data Analytics, AI, and scientific computing as well as production tools and game programming.

This  course  focuses  on  developing  python  programming  to  do  a  variety  of  programming tasks where the students are encouraged to develop basic applications using different open source  tools.  At  the  end  of  the  course,  the  student  will  be  developing  adequate  basic programming skills using python language.

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions to assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
e) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
f) Guide students for open source python editors.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro-project should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

**Case Study 1:** Compare three various tools functionality for python programming development.

**Case Study 2:** List out new features of python 3.9 version and compare with older two different versions.

**Case Study 3:** Study math module of python and explain real life usage with examples.
