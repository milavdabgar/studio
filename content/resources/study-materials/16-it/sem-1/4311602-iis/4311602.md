## 1. RATIONALE

Information  technology  is  a  relatively  new  comprehensive  term  that  describes  the  entire range  of  information  generation,  storage,  transmission,  retrieval,  and  processing.  Most organizations in the industry, business, non-profit organizations, and government departments now rely heavily on their information systems (IS) and information technology (IT).  The  information  system  collects,  stores,  and  disseminates  information  from  the organization's environment and internal operations to support organizational functions and decision-making, communication, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization. Therefore, the knowledge about the various applications areas of Information Technology including practical skills acquired through the laboratory will help students when he/she will be working with information systems.

At the end of the course, students will be able to comfortably work on computers, install and configure OS, connect it to external devices, protect information and computers from basic abuses/attacks. This course is therefore so designed that the students will be able to apply the concepts of IT systems as and when required.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry-identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences.

**Competency Statement:** Apply concepts of Information Technology in various educational, business, and industrial application areas.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

a) Prepare a portfolio for the Digital India platform and identify digital services for Indian citizens.
b) Give a seminar on latest technologies & applications in demand.
c) Identify the existing network structure of your home.
d) Prepare a case study on cyber-crime.
e) Undertake micro-projects in teams.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.

a) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
b) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
c) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature are to be given to the students for self-learning but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
d) With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
e) Guide students for using data manuals.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the micro-project should be about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

**Case Study 1 - Digital India Platform:** Demonstrate the various Digital India initiatives to create awareness about Digital literacy.

**Case Study 2 - Operating System:** Install any flavor of the Linux Operating System by using the virtualization Software (VMware/virtual box).

**Case Study 3 - Networking:** Prepare a report of various Network connecting devices existing at your home/Institute Lab.

**Case Study 4 - Information Security:** Prepare a case study of various cyber-attacks in the current marketplace.
