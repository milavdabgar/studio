Diploma programme in which this course is offered                 Semester in which offered
Information Technology                                          First

## 1. Rationale

Information technology is a relatively new comprehensive term that describes the entire
range of information generation, storage, transmission, retrieval, and processing. Most
organizations in the industry, business, non-profit organizations, and government
departments now rely heavily on their information systems (IS) and information technology
- IT). The information system collects, stores, and disseminates information from the
organization's environment and internal operations to support organizational functions and
decision-making, communication, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization.
Therefore, the knowledge about the various applications areas of Information Technology
including practical skills acquired through the laboratory will help students when he/she will
be working with information systems.

At the end of the course, students will be able to comfortably work on computers, install and
configure OS, connect it to external devices, protect information and computers from basic
abuses/attacks. This course is therefore so designed that the students will be able to apply
the concepts of IT systems as and when required.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry-identified
competency through various teaching-learning experiences.
- Apply concepts of Information Technology in various educational, business, and
industrial application areas.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated
with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the following Course
Outcomes (COs) achievement :
- Appraise the Information technology systems for various educational, business, and
industrial applications.
- Examine basic logic gates for designing digital logic circuits.
- Configure features of different Operating Systems for various applications.
- Demonstrate communication between two computer systems on a network.
- Analyze different parameters of computer network- its communication
cable/devices, topology, and addressing system.
- Appraise information security for data protection and cyberattacks in network
communication.

## 7. Affective Domain Outcomes

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the
## Practical Outcomes

```
above mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfil the development of this
course competency.
- Follow safety practices.
- Practice good housekeeping.
- Demonstrate working as a leader/a team member.
- Maintain tools and equipment
- Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
      ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
      iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical
evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare a portfolio for the Digital India platform and identify digital services for
Indian citizens.
- Give a seminar on latest technologies & applications in demand.
- Identify the existing network structure of your home.
- Prepare a casestudy on cyber-crime.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach
various topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature are to be given to the students for self-learning but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.10, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for using data manuals.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, the number of
students in the group should not exceed three.
The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based,
laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs
## Practical Outcomes

```
which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain
dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar
presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14-
- 6 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought
to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs).
A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the
- Os. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Digital India Platform: Demonstrate the various Digital India initiatives to create
   awareness about Digital literacy.
- Operating System: Install any flavor of the Linux Operating System by using the
   virtualization Software (VMware/virtual box).
- Networking: Prepare a report of various Network connecting devices existing at your
   home/ Institute Lab.
- Information Security: Prepare a case study of various cyber-attacks in the current
   marketplace.
