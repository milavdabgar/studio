## 1. RATIONALE

Information  technology  is  a  relatively  new  comprehensive  term  that  describes  the  entire range  of  information  generation,  storage,  transmission,  retrieval,  and  processing.  Most organizations in the industry, business, non-profit organizations, and government departments now rely heavily on their information systems (IS) and information technology (IT).  The  information  system  collects,  stores,  and  disseminates  information  from  the organization's environment and internal operations to support organizational functions and decision-making, communication, coordination, control, analysis, and visualization. Therefore, the knowledge about the various applications areas of Information Technology including practical skills acquired through the laboratory will help students when he/she will be working with information systems.

At the end of the course, students will be able to comfortably work on computers, install and configure OS, connect it to external devices, protect information and computers from basic abuses/attacks. This course is therefore so designed that the students will be able to apply the concepts of IT systems as and when required.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry-identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences.

- Apply  concepts  of  Information  Technology  in  various  educational,  business,  and industrial application areas.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge and the relevant soft skills associated with the identified competency are to be developed in the student for the following Course Outcomes (COs) achievement :

- a) Appraise the Information technology systems for various educational, business, and industrial applications.
- b) Examine basic logic gates for designing digital logic circuits.
- c) Configure features of different Operating Systems for various applications.
- d) Demonstrate communication between two computer systems on a network.
- e) Analyze different parameters of computer networkits communication cable/devices, topology, and addressing system.
- f) Appraise  information  security  for  data  protection  and  cyberattacks  in  network communication.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The  following sample Affective  Domain  Outcomes  (ADOs)  are  embedded  in  many  of  the above  mentioned  COs  and  PrOs.  More  could  be  added  to  fulfil  the  development  of  this course competency.

- a) Follow safety practices.
- b) Practice good housekeeping.
- c) Demonstrate working as a leader/a team member.
- d) Maintain tools and equipment
- e) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level  of  achievement  of  the  ADOs  according  to  Krathwohl's  'Affective  Domain  Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1 st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2 nd year.
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3 rd year.

Legends: R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

Note : This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions  to  assess  the  attainment  of  the  UOs.  The  actual  distribution  of  marks  at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may slightly vary from above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  studentrelated co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity. They should also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare  a  portfolio  for  the  Digital  India  platform  and  identify  digital  services  for Indian citizens.
- b) Give a seminar on latest technologies &amp; applications in demand.
- c) Identify the existing network structure of your home.
- d) Prepare a casestudy on cyber-crime.
- e) Undertake micro-projects in teams.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:Massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.

- a) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- b) 'L'  in  section  No.  4 means  different  types  of  teaching  methods  that  are  to  be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- c) About 20%  of  the  topics/sub-topics which  are  relatively  simpler  or  descriptive  in nature  are  to  be  given  to  the  students  for self-learning but  to  be  assessed  using different assessment methods.
- d) With respect to section No.10 , teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities .
- e) Guide students for using data manuals.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based (group of 3 to 5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based, laboratory-based  or  field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The duration of the microproject should be about 14 -16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs).

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Digital  India  Platform :  Demonstrate  the  various  Digital  India  initiatives to  create awareness about Digital literacy.
- b) Operating  System :  Install  any  flavor  of  the  Linux  Operating  System  by  using  the virtualization Software (VMware/virtual box).
- c) Networking :  Prepare  a  report  of  various  Network  connecting  devices  existing  at  your home/ Institute Lab.
- d) Information Security: Prepare a case study of various cyber-attacks in the current marketplace.
