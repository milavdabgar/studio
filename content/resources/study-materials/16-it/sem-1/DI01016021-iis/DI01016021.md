## Prerequisite

| Field | Details |
|-------|--------|
| **Prerequisite:** | Basic knowledge of Computer, demonstrated through the school's Test Learning Center. |
| **Rationale:** | Information technology is a relatively new comprehensive term that describes the entire range of information generation, storage, transmission, retrieval, and processing. Most organizations in the industry, business, non-profit organizations, and government departments now rely heavily on their information systems (IS) and information technology (IT). The information system collects, stores, and disseminates information from the organization's environment and internal operations to support organizational functions and decision-making, communication, coordination, control, analysis and visualization. Therefore, the knowledge about the various applications areas of Information Technology including practical skills acquired through the laboratory will help students when he/she will be working with information systems. At the end of the course, students will be able to comfortably work on computers, install and configure OS, connect it to external devices, protect information and computers from basic abuses/attacks. This course is therefore so designed that the students will be able to apply the concepts of IT systems as and when required. |

## Course Outcomes

After completion of the course, students will be able to:
