The software has changed every aspect of our life and made available everything at our finger tips. It has revolutionized every area of human life like education, health, defense and security, finance and business, travel, social life, politics, entertainment and so on. Thus, a software increases the responsibilities for the developer. The software development process in the industry is also changing rapidly. This course guides the students to analyze, design, implement and test the software product with proper documentation during the courses in higher semesters of diploma program. At the end of the course, the student will develop adequate skills of documentation and will understand the application of concepts in software development. |

## Suggested Project List

The project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a project by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

1. Study the SRS document of project from any software company and enlist functional as well as non-functional requirements.
2. Prepare the user interface using online tools of the known system.
3. Design DFD (context, level-1/2) and data dictionary of the selected Project.
4. Search any automated test case generator and prepare test suits for the system.

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the classroom learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- b) Suggest a small existing software/website to students and discuss on betterment of its user-interface design.
- c) Visit a software company and observe their documents and discuss their practices adopted for software development.
- d) Prepare SRS documents based on Case studies.
