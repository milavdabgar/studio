| Rationale:      | One  of  the  important  products  in  the  field  of  Information  Technology  is  a  Software. The software has changed every aspect of our life and made available  everything of our finger tips. It has revolutionized every area of human life like  education, health, defense and security, finance and business, travel, social life,  politics, entertainment and so on. Thus, a software increases the responsibilities  for  the  developer.  The  software  development  process  in  the  industry  is  also  changing rapidly.    This  course  guides  the  students  to  analyze,  design,  implement  and  test  the  software  product  with  proper  documentation  during  the  courses  in  higher  semesters of diploma program. At the end of the course, the student will develop  adequate skills of documentation and will understand the application of concepts  in software development. |

The project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a project by the end of the semester to develop the industryoriented COs.

A suggestive list of projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- 1) Study the SRS document of project from any software company and enlist functional as well as non-functional requirements.
- 2) Prepare the user interface using online tools of the known system.
- 3) Design DFD (context, level-1/2) and data dictionary of the selected Project.
- 4) Search any automated test case generator and prepare test suits for the system.

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other  than  the  classroom  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  student-related  co-curricular activities  which  can  be  undertaken  to  accelerate  the  attainment  of  the  various  outcomes  in  this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- b) Suggest a small existing software/website to students and discuss on betterment of its user-interface design.
- c) Visit  a  software  company  and  observe  their  documents  and  discuss  their  practices adopted for software development.
- d) Prepare SRS documents based on Case studies.
