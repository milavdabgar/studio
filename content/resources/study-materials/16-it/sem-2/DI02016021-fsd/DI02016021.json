  "rationale": "One of the important products in the field of Information Technology is a Software. The software has changed every aspect of our life and made available everything at our finger tips. It has revolutionized every area of human life like education, health, defense and security, finance and business, travel, social life, politics, entertainment and so on. Thus, a software increases the responsibilities for the developer. The software development process in the industry is also changing rapidly. This course guides the students to analyze, design, implement and test the software product with proper documentation during the courses in higher semesters of diploma program. At the end of the course, the student will develop adequate skills of documentation and will understand the application of concepts in software development.",
