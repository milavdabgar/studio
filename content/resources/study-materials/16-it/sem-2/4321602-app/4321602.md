Information Technology                             Second

## 1. Rationale

In previous semester (Semester I) students have learned basics of python programming.
They understand developing programs to solve simple problems using various features of
the ‘Python’ language. Python is a modern language useful for writing compact codes
specifically for programming in the area of Server-side Web development, Data Analytics, AI,
and scientific computing as well as production tools and game programming. This course
deals with some advanced features of the ‘Python’ language. The programming skills thus
acquired can be used for developing programs with advanced level programming features
which in turn will be helping in developing practical applications for the scientific, research
and business purposes. At the end of the course, the student will be able to develop
programs with adequate advanced concepts using python language.

## 2. Competency

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified
competency through various teaching-learning experiences:
- Develop a program using advanced python language concepts to solve the given
problem.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)
The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge, and the relevant soft skills associated
with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

The student will develop underpinning knowledge, adequate programming skills of
competency for implementing various applications using python programming language to
attain the following course outcomes.

- Develop python programs by applying data structures - dictionary, tuple, and set
concepts.
- Develop modules and packages in python programs for modular programming
approach.
- Implement error handling techniques using exception handling.
- Develop python programs using file input/output operations.

above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this
competency.
- Work as a leader/a team member.
- Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the
level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl’s ‘Affective Domain Taxonomy’
should gradually increase as planned below:
‘Valuing Level’ in 1st year
    ii. ‘Organization Level’ in 2nd year.
    iii. ‘Characterization Level’ in 3rd year.

## 8. Underpinning Theory

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom’s
taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the
students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the
course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

Note: This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning
and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test
items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at
different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the

## 10. Suggested Student Activities

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-
related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and
prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for
their (student’s) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:
- Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
- Undertake micro-projects in teams
- Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.

- 1. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)
These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the
various outcomes in this course:
- Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various
topics/subtopics.
- Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- ‘L’ in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be
employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in
nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using
different assessment methods.
- With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and
provisions for co-curricular activities.
- Guide students for open source python editors.

- 2. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS
Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned
to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project
are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be
individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become
problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations
where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group
should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more
## Practical Outcomes

```
- Os which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to
 maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and
 give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project
 should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The
 student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry
 oriented COs.
         A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency
and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:
- Case Study 1: Create an English dictionary that is able to perform the following
         function.
- Add a word and its meaning.
                ii) Delete a word and its meaning.
                iii) Update word or it’s meaning.
                iv) Print a list of word and their meaning.
- Case Study 2: Build the famous snake game with python's turtle module.
- Case Study 3: Draw the famous cartoon character Doraemon, Shinchan with Turtle
