## 1. RATIONALE

In  previous  semester  (Semester  I)  students  have  learned  basics  of  python  programming. They understand developing programs to solve simple problems using  various features of the  'Python'  language.  Python  is  a  modern  language  useful  for  writing  compact  codes specifically for programming in the area of Server-side Web development, Data Analytics, AI, and  scientific  computing  as  well  as  production  tools  and  game  programming.  This  course deals with some advanced features of the 'Python' language. The programming skills thus acquired can be used for developing programs with advanced level programming features which in turn will be helping in developing practical applications for the scientific, research and  business  purposes.  At  the  end  of  the  course,  the  student  will  be  able  to  develop programs with adequate advanced concepts using python language.

## 2. COMPETENCY

The purpose of this course is to help the student to attain the following industry identified competency through various teaching-learning experiences:

- Develop a program using advanced python language concepts to solve the given problem.

## 3. COURSE OUTCOMES (COs)

The practical exercises, the underpinning knowledge, and the relevant soft skills associated with this competency are to be developed in the student to display the following COs:

The student will develop underpinning knowledge, adequate programming skills of competency for implementing various applications using python programming language to attain the following course outcomes.

- a) Develop python programs by applying data structures - dictionary, tuple, and set concepts.

## 7. AFFECTIVE DOMAIN OUTCOMES

The following sample Affective Domain Outcomes (ADOs) are embedded in many of the above-mentioned COs and PrOs. More could be added to fulfill the development of this competency.

- a) Work as a leader/a team member.
- b) Follow ethical practices.

The ADOs are best developed through the laboratory/field based exercises. Moreover, the level of achievement of the ADOs according to Krathwohl's 'Affective Domain Taxonomy' should gradually increase as planned below:

- i. 'Valuing Level' in 1st year
- ii. 'Organization Level' in 2nd year
- iii. 'Characterization Level' in 3rd year

## 8. UNDERPINNING THEORY

Only the major Underpinning Theory is formulated as higher-level UOs of Revised Bloom's taxonomy in order development of the COs and competency is not missed out by the students and teachers. If required, more such higher-level UOs could be included by the course teacher to focus on the attainment of COs and competency.

**Legends:** R=Remember, U=Understand, A=Apply and above (Revised Bloom's taxonomy)

**Note:** This specification table provides general guidelines to assist students for their learning and to teachers to teach and question paper designers/setters to formulate test items/questions assess the attainment of the UOs. The actual distribution of marks at different taxonomy levels (of R, U and A) in the question paper may vary slightly from the above table.

## 10. SUGGESTED STUDENT ACTIVITIES

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student-related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student's) portfolio which will be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare a document which differentiates python versions.
- b) Undertake micro-projects in teams
- c) Give a seminar on any relevant topics.
- d) Undertake a market survey of different python frameworks.

## 11. SUGGESTED SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES (if any)

These are sample strategies, which the teacher can use to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course:

- a) Massive open online courses (MOOCs) may be used to teach various topics/subtopics.
- b) Guide student(s) in undertaking micro-projects.
- c) 'L' in section No. 4 means different types of teaching methods that are to be employed by teachers to develop the outcomes.
- d) About 20% of the topics/sub-topics which are relatively simpler or descriptive in nature is to be given to the students for self-learning, but to be assessed using different assessment methods.
- e) With respect to section No.11, teachers need to ensure to create opportunities and provisions for co-curricular activities.
- f) Guide students for open source python editors.

## 12. SUGGESTED MICRO-PROJECTS

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are group-based. However, in the fifth and sixth semesters, it should be preferably be individually undertaken to build up the skill and confidence in every student to become problem solver so that s/he contributes to the projects of the industry. In special situations where groups have to be formed for micro-projects, the number of students in the group should not exceed three.

The micro-project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each micro-project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission. The total duration of the micro-project should not be less than 16 (sixteen) student engagement hours during the course. The student ought to submit a micro-project by the end of the semester to develop the industry oriented COs.

A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs. Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- **Case Study 1:** Create an English dictionary that is able to perform the following functions:
  
  i) Add a word and its meaning.
  
  ii) Delete a word and its meaning.
  
  iii) Update word or its meaning.
  
  iv) Print a list of words and their meanings.
- **Case Study 2:** Build the famous snake game with Python's turtle module.
- **Case Study 3:** Draw the famous cartoon character Doraemon or Shinchan with Turtle module
