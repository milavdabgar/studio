| **Category of the Course:** | PCC-02                                                       |
| **Prerequisite:**           | A solid understanding of basic Python concepts including syntax, control flow, functions, and the ability to write basic Python programs |
| **Rationale:**              | In the previous semester (Semester I) students have learned the basics of python programming.  They  understand  developing  programs  to  solve  simple  problems using  various  features  of  the  'Python'  language.  Python  is  a  modern  language useful  for  writing  compact  codes  specifically  for  programming  in  the  area  of Server-side  Web  development,  Data  Analytics,  AI,  and  scientific  computing  as well  as  production  tools  and  game  programming.  This  course  deals  with  some advanced features of the 'Python' language. The programming skills thus acquired can be used for developing programs with advanced level programming features which in turn will be helping in developing practical applications for the scientific, research and business purposes. At the end of the course, the student will be able to develop programs with adequate advanced concepts using python language. |

Note :-

More Practical Exercises can be designed and offered by the respective course teacher to develop the industry relevant skills/outcomes to match the COs. The above table is only a suggestive list.

## List of Laboratory/Learning Resources Required

| Sr. No. | Laboratory/Learning Resources/Equipment Name with Broad  Specifications | PrO. No. |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| 1       | Computer system with operating system: Windows 7 or higher version, macOS, and Linux, with 4GB or higher RAM, Python versions: 2.7.X, 3.6.X, or higher version. | All      |

## Suggested Project List

Only one project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. The project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each project should encompass two or more COs which are in fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before submission.  The  duration  of  the  project  should  be  about  14-  16  (fourteen  to  sixteen)  student engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit projects by the end of the semester to develop the industry-oriented COs.

A suggestive list of projects is given here. This has to match the COs. Similar projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

## i) Expense Tracker

- Record expenses with dictionaries, analyze data via modules, handle input errors, and use JSON for storage

## ii) Attendance Tracker

- Track  attendance  using  dictionaries  and  sets,  handle  invalid  entries,  and  save  data  in CSV/JSON files.

## iii) Animated Scene

- Create  an  animated  scene  like  a  sunrise,  a  bouncing  ball,  or  a  moving  car  using  turtle methods.

## iv) Tic-Tac-Toe Board

- Draw a Tic-Tac-Toe grid with turtle graphics and highlight moves using turtle methods.

## Suggested Activities for Students

Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student related co-curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for  each  activity,  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their  (student's)  portfolio  which  will  be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Build an application using advanced Python concepts, such as a web scraper, chat application, or inventory management system.
- b) Experiment with libraries like NumPy, pandas, or requests for data analysis, or advanced functionality.
- c) Work on projects involving API integration to fetch, process, and display data from external sources.
- d) Engage in Python-specific coding competitions or solve advanced-level problems on platforms like HackerRank, LeetCode, or Codewars.
