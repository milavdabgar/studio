**Academic Year:** 2024-2025

Semester:                         2nd

Category of the Course:           PCC-02

Prerequisite: A solid understanding of basic Python concepts including syntax, control flow,
functions, and the ability to write basic Python programs
Rationale:    In the previous semester (Semester I) students have learned the basics of python
programming. They understand developing programs to solve simple problems
using various features of the ‘Python’ language. Python is a modern language
useful for writing compact codes specifically for programming in the area of
Server-side Web development, Data Analytics, AI, and scientific computing as
well as production tools and game programming. This course deals with some
advanced features of the ‘Python’ language. The programming skills thus acquired
can be used for developing programs with advanced level programming features
which in turn will be helping in developing practical applications for the scientific,
research and business purposes. At the end of the course, the student will be able
to develop programs with adequate advanced concepts using python language.

Course Outcome:

After Completion of the Course, Student will able to:
- BT Level
No                                   Course Outcomes
Develop python programs by applying data structures - dictionary, tuple, and set         Apply
concepts.

approach.
- 3   Implement error handling techniques using exception handling.                            Apply

- 4   Develop python programs using file input/output operations.                              Apply

Suggested Project List:
Only one project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the
beginning of the semester. The project could be industry application based, internet-based, workshop-
based, laboratory-based or field-based. Each project should encompass two or more COs which are in

fact, an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain a dated work diary
consisting of individual contributions in the project work and give a seminar presentation of it before
submission. The duration of the project should be about 14- 16 (fourteen to sixteen) student
engagement hours during the course. The students ought to submit projects by the end of the semester
to develop the industry-oriented COs.
A suggestive list of projects is given here. This has to match the COs. Similar projects could be added
by the concerned course teacher:
- Expense Tracker
- Record expenses with dictionaries, analyze data via modules, handle input errors, and use
- SON for storage
ii) Attendance Tracker
- Track attendance using dictionaries and sets, handle invalid entries, and save data in
- SV/JSON files.
iii) Animated Scene
- Create an animated scene like a sunrise, a bouncing ball, or a moving car using turtle
            methods.
iv) Tic-Tac-Toe Board
- Draw a Tic-Tac-Toe grid with turtle graphics and highlight moves using turtle methods.

Suggested Activities for Students:
Other than the classroom and laboratory learning, following are the suggested student related co-
curricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in
this course: Students should conduct following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages
for each activity, also collect/record physical evidences for their (student’s) portfolio which will be
useful for their placement interviews:
