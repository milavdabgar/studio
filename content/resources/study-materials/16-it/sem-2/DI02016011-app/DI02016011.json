  "rationale": "In the previous semester (Semester I) students have learned the basics of python programming. They understand developing programs to solve simple problems using various features of the 'Python' language. Python is a modern language useful for writing compact codes specifically for programming in the area of Server-side Web development, Data Analytics, AI, and scientific computing as well as production tools and game programming. This course deals with some advanced features of the 'Python' language. The programming skills thus acquired can be used for developing programs with advanced level programming features which in turn will be helping in developing practical applications for the scientific, research and business purposes. At the end of the course, the student will be able to develop programs with adequate advanced concepts using python language.",
