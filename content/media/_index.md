## Why I Share These

I believe that our media consumption shapes our thinking and perspective. These collections serve multiple purposes:

- Providing resources that others may find useful or enlightening
- Sharing content that has influenced my own learning journey
- Documenting personal favorites for future reference
- Creating a platform for discussion around shared interests

## Content Philosophy

These collections are continually evolving as I discover new content. I aim to:

- Focus on quality over quantity
- Include diverse perspectives and sources
- Provide context for why each piece is meaningful
- Organize content in a way that makes it easily discoverable

I welcome suggestions for additions to these collections - if you've found something that resonates with the themes here, feel free to [share your recommendations](mailto:milav.dabgar@gmail.com).
