## Purpose & Vision

PlanetMilav is my digital garden where I share knowledge and experiences I find valuable. The site serves as both a personal reference and a resource for others interested in electronics, embedded systems, programming, and data science.

I created this platform with several goals in mind:

1. To document solutions to technical problems I've encountered
2. To share educational resources with students and fellow enthusiasts
3. To track my learning journey across various technical domains
4. To connect with like-minded individuals in the tech community

## Content Focus

As a Lecturer in Electronics and Communication at Government Polytechnic, Palanpur, much of the study material shared here is at the Diploma level. However, I also cover more advanced topics that reflect my personal interests and ongoing education.

The content generally falls into these categories:

| Category | Topics Covered |
|----------|----------------|
| **Electronics** | Circuit design, PCB layout, component selection |
| **Embedded Systems** | Microcontrollers, firmware, real-time systems |
| **Programming** | C/C++, Python, R, and other languages |
| **Data Science** | Machine learning, computer vision, data analysis |
| **IOT** | Sensors, wireless protocols, cloud integration |
| **Academic Resources** | Course materials, project guides, references |

## About the Author

I'm Milav Dabgar, an Electronics and Communication Engineering professional with experience in both academia and industry. My background includes:

- **Current Role**: GES Class II Lecturer at Government Polytechnic, Palanpur
- **Previous Experience**: Electronics Engineer at TEXEG India Private Limited
- **Education**: 
  - M.E. in Communication Systems Engineering from L.D College of Engineering
  - B.E. in Electronics and Communication Engineering

I'm passionate about continuous learning and applying technology to solve real-world problems. When I'm not teaching or working on technical projects, I enjoy music and practicing yoga.

## Site Philosophy

While I welcome suggestions to improve content quality, my primary focus is on substance rather than presentation. I'm not a professional web developer - my goal is to document and share knowledge effectively.

I believe in:

- **Open sharing of knowledge**: Making technical information accessible to all
- **Practical application**: Focusing on real-world applications of theoretical concepts
- **Continuous improvement**: Regularly updating content with new learnings
- **Community engagement**: Learning from and contributing to the wider technical community
