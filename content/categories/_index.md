Categories organize content by broad subject areas, making it easier to find related material across various technical domains. This taxonomic approach helps both casual readers and serious learners navigate the site efficiently.

## Primary Categories

The content on PlanetMilav is organized into these major categories:

| Category | Description | Target Audience |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Embedded Systems** | Microcontroller programming, hardware design, firmware development, and real-time systems | Engineering students, hobbyists, professionals |
| **Programming** | Tutorials, best practices, and project examples in various programming languages | Beginners to advanced programmers |
| **Data Science** | Statistical analysis, machine learning, data visualization, and practical applications | Students, researchers, data enthusiasts |
| **Electronics** | Circuit design, component selection, PCB layout, and electronic principles | Electronics students, makers, engineers |
| **Education** | Teaching methodologies, student resources, and academic guidance | Students, educators, lifelong learners |
| **Technical Guides** | Step-by-step procedures, troubleshooting, and reference materials | Practitioners, technicians, implementers |

## Category Features

Each category section includes:

- **Foundational content** for beginners new to the subject
- **Intermediate topics** for those advancing their knowledge
- **Advanced material** for experienced practitioners
- **Project examples** demonstrating practical applications
- **Resource listings** for further learning

## How to Use Categories

Categories provide a structured way to explore the site:

1. **Browse by domain** - Start with a broad category that matches your area of interest
2. **Narrow your focus** - Use subcategories or tags to find more specific content
3. **Follow learning paths** - Some categories offer suggested sequences for progressive learning
4. **Discover connections** - Explore how different categories relate to and complement each other

The category system complements the tag system, with categories representing broader domains while tags identify specific technologies, concepts, or applications within those domains.

## Subject Area Expertise

While all categories contain thoroughly researched content, these areas represent primary domains of expertise:

- Embedded systems and microcontroller programming
- Electronics design and troubleshooting
- Data analysis and machine learning applications
- Technical education and teaching methodologies

Content in other categories is developed through ongoing learning, professional development, and collaboration with subject matter experts.
