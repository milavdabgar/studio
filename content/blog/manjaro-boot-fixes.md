Boot issues in Manjaro Linux often occur after system updates, especially when kernel or bootloader packages are updated. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the recovery process step-by-step, helping you get your system back up and running.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the recovery process, you'll need:

- A Manjaro Linux live USB/DVD (use the same version as your installed system if possible)
- Basic knowledge of terminal commands
- Access to your system's root password (if set)

## Step 1: Boot from the Live USB/DVD

1. Insert your Manjaro Linux live USB or DVD
2. Restart your computer
3. Access your BIOS/UEFI boot menu (usually by pressing F12, F11, or Esc during startup)
4. Select the USB drive or DVD to boot from
5. Choose "Boot Manjaro Linux" from the boot menu (not the installer option)
6. Wait for the live environment to fully load

## Step 2: Identify Your Manjaro Partition

First, you need to identify which partition contains your Manjaro installation:

```bash
# List all partitions
sudo fdisk -l

# Or use this command to show mounted partitions and their sizes
lsblk -f

# If you're unsure which partition has Manjaro, run OS-Prober
sudo os-prober
```

Note down the partition that contains your Manjaro installation (e.g., `/dev/sda2`, `/dev/nvme0n1p3`, etc.).

## Step 3: Mount Your Manjaro System

Now you'll mount your Manjaro partition and prepare to chroot into it:

```bash
# Become root (you'll be prompted for the password)
sudo su

# Mount your Manjaro root partition (replace /dev/sdXY with your actual partition)
mount /dev/sdXY /mnt

# Check if you have a separate boot partition
lsblk -f

# If you have a separate boot partition, mount it too
# For standard boot partition:
mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/boot
# For EFI partition:
mount /dev/sdXZ /mnt/boot/efi
```

## Step 4: Prepare the chroot Environment

Before entering the chroot environment, mount the necessary system directories:

```bash
# Mount the proc filesystem
mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc/

# Mount the sys filesystem
mount --rbind /sys /mnt/sys/

# Mount the dev filesystem
mount --rbind /dev /mnt/dev/

# Mount the run filesystem
mount --rbind /run /mnt/run/
```

## Step 5: Enter the chroot Environment

Now you can enter your installed Manjaro system through chroot:

```bash
# Enter chroot environment
chroot /mnt
```

You are now working within your installed Manjaro system, not the live environment.

## Step 6: Update and Repair the System

Now that you're in the chroot environment, update and repair your system:

```bash
# Synchronize and update all packages
pacman -Syyu

# If there were problems with specific packages, reinstall them
# For example, to reinstall the kernel:
pacman -S linux$(uname -r | cut -d. -f1-2 | tr -d .)

# To reinstall GRUB (for BIOS systems):
pacman -S grub
grub-install /dev/sdX  # Replace with your drive (not partition)
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

# For UEFI systems:
pacman -S grub efibootmgr
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=manjaro --recheck
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

## Step 7: Exit and Reboot

Once you've completed the repairs, exit the chroot environment and reboot:

```bash
# Exit the chroot environment
exit

# Unmount all mounted partitions
umount -R /mnt

# Reboot the system
reboot
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing or Corrupted Kernel

If your system won't boot because of a missing or corrupted kernel:

```bash
# Within the chroot environment, reinstall the kernel
pacman -S linux$(uname -r | cut -d. -f1-2 | tr -d .)
```

### Corrupted GRUB Configuration

If GRUB is not showing or is showing errors:

```bash
# Within the chroot environment
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### Failed Update

If your system failed during an update:

```bash
# Within the chroot environment
pacman -Syyuu  # Force synchronization and update
```

### Package Manager Database Locks

If pacman is locked:

```bash
# Within the chroot environment
rm /var/lib/pacman/db.lck
```

## Preventive Measures

To avoid boot problems in the future:

1. **Always back up important data before major updates**
2. **Create a timeshift snapshot before updating**:
   ```bash
   sudo timeshift --create --comments "Before system update"
   ```
3. **Keep a live USB handy for emergency recovery**
4. **Read update notifications carefully before proceeding**
