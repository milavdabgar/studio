Create simple GTU paper solutions using a systematic artifact-based approach for weak students who struggle with exams. I've uploaded a paper PDF.

## GUIDELINES FOR SOLUTION CREATION

### 1. Artifact Organization

- Create complete paper solution in a single artifact with proper title: `[subject-code]-[season]-[year]-solution`
- When hitting message length limits, continue in new artifact labeled "Part 2", "Part 3", etc.
- First create the complete English version, then create the Gujarati version
- Example for English: `4341101-summer-2024-solution`
- Example for Gujarati: `4341101-summer-2024-solution.gu`
- Add YAML Front Matter to the artifact, as per below example

```yaml

title: "Microprocessor and Microcontroller (4341101) - Summer 2023 Solution"
date: 2023-06-15
description: "Solution guide for Microprocessor and Microcontroller (4341101) Summer 2023 exam"
summary: "Detailed solutions and explanations for the Summer 2023 exam of Microprocessor and Microcontroller (4341101)"
tags: ["study-material", "solutions", "microprocessor", "4341101", "2023", "summer"]

```

### 2. FORMAT for Questions and Answers

```markdown
## Question X(y) [Z marks] or Question X(y OR) [Z marks]

[**Question text in bold face**]

**Answer**:
[Answer content with diagrams, tables, simple code blocks Bullet Points for key points related to quest as per below format]

**Diagram/Table/CodeBlock:**
- Each answer should have at least one diagram, table, or code block. choose the best one based on the question.

- **Bold keyword 1**: Brief explanation
- **Bold keyword 2**: Brief explanation

**Mnemonic:** "Easy-to-remember phrase"
```

### 3. Content Requirements and Priority Order

1. **FIRST PRIORITY**: Use **tables** for comparisons and lists (always try this first)
2. **SECOND PRIORITY**: Include a **simple diagram** using mermaid/goat/ASCII/SVG if it helps explain concepts.
3. **THIRD PRIORITY**: For coding questions, write the **simplest, shortest code** possible
4. **FOURTH PRIORITY**: Use bullet points with **bold keywords** only if needed and within word limits

- **Reduced word count** for very weak students - strictly follow these limits:
  - 3-mark questions: 60-75 words
  - 4-mark questions: 75-90 words
  - 7-mark questions: 125-150 words

### 4. Solution Structural Elements

1. Keep diagrams and tables **simple and easy to understand** - they should be the primary method to explain concepts
2. Use **proper markdown syntax** for all formatting
3. Each bullet point (if used) should have **bold keywords** that help students memorize key terms
4. Create memorable **mnemonics** to help students recall the answer
5. Create code as **minimal and simple** as possible, as weak students struggle with coding
6. For diagrams:
   - Use mermaid, SVG, GOAT-ASCII or ASCII art that's compatible with pandoc and Hugo
   - Give first priority to mermaid diagrams for flowcharts, sequence diagrams, class diagrams, state diagrams, ER diagrams, Gantt charts, Pie charts, Mind maps, Timelines
   - Use goat or ASCII art only when mermaid can't fulfill the visualization requirements
   - Choose the right diagram type that best explains the concept in the question, rather than using mermaid for everything
   - For AsCII art, use the `goat` code fences as hugo renders them perfectly. Use only English glyphs in ASCII goat diagrams (not Gujarati characters) due to Hugo rendering limitations
   - For mermaid, use the mermaid code fences i.e. ```mermaid
   - Do not use image references or links
   - For circuit diagrams, ASCII art often works best
   - For flowcharts and architecture diagrams, mermaid is preferred

### 5. Gujarati Translation Guidelines

- Use natural, conversational Gujarati while adapting content culturally (not word-for-word translation)
- Keep technical terms in English (programming terms, keywords, etc.)
- Include all diagrams, tables, and visual elements in the Gujarati version identical to the English version
- Use only English glyphs in ASCII goat diagrams (not Gujarati characters) due to Hugo rendering limitations
- Ensure both English and Gujarati versions present the same level of detail and content
- Make sure that you use gujarati glyphs and transliterate properly and not just give overuse english. use english only when it makes sense. acceptable and not acceptable ways are:

```markdown
Not at all accepted:
- HTTP requests handle કરે
- Load balancing અને caching
- Security features provide કરે

accepted statements:
- HTTP રિક્વેસ્ટ્સ હૅન્ડલ  કરે
- લોડ બેલેસિંગ એન્ડ કેશિંગ
- સિક્યોરિટી ફીચર્સ પ્રોવાઈડ કરે
```

### 6. Common Markdown Lint errors to avoid

- MD032/blanks-around-lists: Lists should be surrounded by blank lines
- MD031/blanks-around-fences: Fenced code blocks should be surrounded by blank
- MD058/blanks-around-tables: Tables should be surrounded by blank

In Each new chat I'll also attach Syllabus of the subject for which we are preparing paper solution, refer this to get the context so that you prepare solutions that adhere to the syllabus.

And final Reminder, This paper solution is for weak students who struggle with exams. So, make sure to not exceed the word limit and keep the content simple and easy to understand.
