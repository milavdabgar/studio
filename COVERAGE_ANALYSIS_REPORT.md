# MongoDB Migration Coverage Analysis Report

**Date**: $(date)  
**Status**: ❌ HIGH RISK - Test Coverage Insufficient for Safe Migration

## 📊 Current Coverage Status

### Jest Unit Tests
- ✅ **Overall Coverage**: 82.8% (Good)
- ✅ **Test Success Rate**: 313/313 passing (100%)
- ✅ **Service Layer Coverage**: Well tested

### API Endpoint Coverage  
- ❌ **Total API Endpoints**: 118
- ❌ **Unit Tested**: 23 (19% coverage)
- ❌ **E2E Tested**: ~20 (16% coverage)
- ⚠️ **Coverage Gap**: 95 endpoints lack comprehensive tests

### MongoDB Migration Status
- ✅ **Migrated**: Users, Roles (MongoDB)
- ❌ **Not Migrated**: ~95 endpoints still use in-memory storage
- ⚠️ **In-memory References**: 560+ found in codebase

## 🚨 Risk Assessment: **7/7 HIGH RISK**

### Critical Issues
1. **Low API Test Coverage** (19%) - Most endpoints untested
2. **Low E2E Coverage** (16%) - Critical user flows not validated  
3. **Extensive In-Memory Usage** - High migration complexity
4. **Production Risk** - No safety net for migration failures

## 💡 Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Test Coverage Improvement (4-6 weeks)
**Goal**: Achieve 90%+ test coverage before migration

#### Week 1-2: Critical API Endpoints
- [ ] Authentication/Authorization endpoints
- [ ] User management (users, roles, permissions)
- [ ] Core academic data (students, faculty, courses)

#### Week 3-4: Business Logic Endpoints  
- [ ] Academic management (programs, batches, enrollments)
- [ ] Results and assessments
- [ ] Timetables and room allocations

#### Week 5-6: Administrative Endpoints
- [ ] Infrastructure management
- [ ] Committee and project management
- [ ] Settings and configuration

### Phase 2: Migration Preparation (2 weeks)
- [ ] Create comprehensive migration scripts
- [ ] Set up MongoDB staging environment
- [ ] Implement data validation tools
- [ ] Create rollback procedures

### Phase 3: Incremental Migration (4-6 weeks)
- [ ] Migrate core entities first (users, roles, permissions)
- [ ] Migrate academic data (students, faculty, courses)
- [ ] Migrate operational data (results, attendance)
- [ ] Migrate administrative data (last)

## 📋 Coverage Metrics to Track

### Target Coverage Goals
- **Unit Test Coverage**: 90%+
- **API Endpoint Coverage**: 85%+ 
- **E2E Critical Flows**: 80%+
- **Branch Coverage**: 75%+

### Weekly Tracking
- [ ] Monday: Run coverage analysis
- [ ] Wednesday: Review progress, adjust priorities
- [ ] Friday: Update coverage metrics, plan next week

## 🎯 Success Criteria

Before proceeding with migration:
- [ ] ≥90% API endpoint unit test coverage
- [ ] ≥80% E2E coverage for critical user flows  
- [ ] All existing tests passing consistently
- [ ] MongoDB staging environment validated
- [ ] Migration rollback procedures tested

## 📈 Progress Tracking

Use this checklist to track testing progress:

### Core API Groups (Priority 1)
- [ ] Authentication (`/api/auth/*`)
- [ ] Users (`/api/users/*`) 
- [ ] Roles (`/api/roles/*`)
- [ ] Permissions (`/api/permissions/*`)

### Academic Core (Priority 2)  
- [ ] Students (`/api/students/*`)
- [ ] Faculty (`/api/faculty/*`)
- [ ] Courses (`/api/courses/*`)
- [ ] Programs (`/api/programs/*`)

### Academic Operations (Priority 3)
- [ ] Enrollments (`/api/enrollments/*`)
- [ ] Results (`/api/results/*`)
- [ ] Assessments (`/api/assessments/*`)
- [ ] Attendance (`/api/attendance/*`)

### Infrastructure (Priority 4)
- [ ] Timetables (`/api/timetables/*`)
- [ ] Rooms (`/api/rooms/*`)
- [ ] Buildings (`/api/buildings/*`)

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. **Immediate** (This Week):
   - Review current test files in `src/lib/api/*.test.ts`
   - Identify highest-priority untested endpoints
   - Start writing tests for authentication flows

2. **Short Term** (Next 2 Weeks):
   - Implement comprehensive API endpoint tests
   - Set up automated coverage reporting
   - Create test data fixtures and helpers

3. **Medium Term** (1-2 Months):
   - Achieve target coverage metrics
   - Validate migration scripts in staging
   - Begin incremental MongoDB migration

**⚠️ Migration Risk**: Currently TOO HIGH to proceed safely  
**📝 Action Required**: Implement comprehensive test suite first  
**🎯 Target**: 90%+ coverage before any further migration
