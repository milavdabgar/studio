# Playwright MCP Server Integration

## Overview

This project now includes a custom Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for automated testing and debugging with Playwright. The MCP server provides a standardized interface for interacting with your Playwright test suite through AI assistants and other MCP-compatible tools.

## Setup Complete ✅

The MCP server has been successfully set up with the following components:

### 🚀 Available Commands

The following npm scripts have been added to your `package.json`:

- `npm run mcp:start` - Start the MCP server
- `npm run mcp:dev` - Start the MCP server in development mode with auto-reload
- `npm run mcp:build` - Build the MCP server TypeScript code
- `npm run mcp:test` - Test the MCP server functionality

### 🛠️ MCP Server Capabilities

The MCP server provides the following tools:

#### 1. **run_playwright_test**
Execute Playwright tests with various configurations.

**Use cases:**
- Run all tests or specific test files
- Run tests on different browsers (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- Run tests in headed or headless mode
- Enable debug mode for troubleshooting

#### 2. **debug_playwright_test**
Debug Playwright tests with breakpoints and step-through capabilities.

**Use cases:**
- Set breakpoints at specific line numbers
- Step through test execution
- Inspect variables and application state
- Debug failing tests interactively

#### 3. **generate_playwright_test**
Automatically generate new test files based on user actions.

**Use cases:**
- Create tests by describing user interactions
- Generate tests for new features or pages
- Quickly scaffold test cases from action sequences

#### 4. **analyze_test_results**
Analyze test results and generate detailed reports.

**Use cases:**
- Get comprehensive test run summaries
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Generate HTML reports for stakeholders
- Track test trends over time

#### 5. **get_test_coverage**
Retrieve test coverage information.

**Use cases:**
- Monitor code coverage percentages
- Identify untested code paths
- Generate coverage reports in multiple formats

#### 6. **list_test_files**
List and filter available test files.

**Use cases:**
- Discover existing tests
- Filter tests by patterns
- Organize test suites

### 🔧 VS Code Integration

The MCP server is configured to work seamlessly with VS Code:

#### Settings Configuration
- MCP server is registered in `.vscode/settings.json`
- Playwright extension settings are optimized
- Environment variables are properly configured

#### Tasks Available
- **Start MCP Server**: Launch the server in production mode
- **Start MCP Server (Dev Mode)**: Launch with auto-reload for development
- **Build MCP Server**: Compile TypeScript code
- **Test MCP Server**: Verify server functionality
- **Run Playwright Tests**: Execute your test suite

### 🎯 Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Running Tests via MCP
```json
{
  "tool": "run_playwright_test",
  "parameters": {
    "testFile": "e2e/dashboard.spec.ts",
    "browser": "chromium",
    "headless": false
  }
}
```

#### Example 2: Generating a New Test
```json
{
  "tool": "generate_playwright_test",
  "parameters": {
    "url": "http://localhost:9003/login",
    "testName": "User authentication flow",
    "actions": [
      {
        "type": "fill",
        "selector": "#email",
        "value": "user@example.com"
      },
      {
        "type": "fill",  
        "selector": "#password",
        "value": "password123"
      },
      {
        "type": "click",
        "selector": "#login-button"
      },
      {
        "type": "assert",
        "selector": "#dashboard-title",
        "value": "Welcome to Dashboard"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Example 3: Debugging a Test
```json
{
  "tool": "debug_playwright_test",
  "parameters": {
    "testFile": "e2e/auth.spec.ts",
    "testName": "should login successfully",
    "breakpoints": [15, 25, 40]
  }
}
```

### 🔍 Testing the Setup

The MCP server has been tested and verified to be working correctly. The test results show:

✅ **Server Status**: Running successfully  
✅ **Tool Registration**: All 6 tools properly registered  
✅ **Communication**: JSON-RPC protocol working  
✅ **Integration**: VS Code configuration complete  

### 🔗 Integration with Your Project

The MCP server is specifically configured for your project:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9003` (matches your dev server)
- **Test Directory**: `./e2e` (matches your existing Playwright setup)
- **Workspace Root**: `/Users/milav/Code/studio`
- **Browser Support**: Chromium, Firefox, WebKit

### 📝 Next Steps

1. **Start the MCP Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run mcp:start
   ```

2. **Use with AI Assistants**: The server is ready to work with MCP-compatible AI tools and assistants.

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**: The server can be used in automated workflows for continuous testing.

4. **Extend Functionality**: Add custom tools to the server by modifying the source code in `mcp-server/src/`.

### 🚨 Important Notes

- The MCP server runs as a separate process and communicates via stdio
- Make sure to build the server (`npm run mcp:build`) after making changes to the source code
- The server requires Playwright to be installed and configured in your project
- Debug mode works best with headed browser mode for visual inspection
