[0:00.16 - 0:03.19] Speaker: Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're uh
[0:03.19 - 0:03.20] Speaker: Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're uh
[0:03.20 - 0:05.35] Speaker: Welcome to the deep dive. Today we're uh plunging into something pretty invisible
[0:05.35 - 0:05.36] Speaker: plunging into something pretty invisible
[0:05.36 - 0:08.07] Speaker: plunging into something pretty invisible but absolutely crucial. It's the world
[0:08.07 - 0:08.08] Speaker: but absolutely crucial. It's the world
[0:08.08 - 0:10.71] Speaker: but absolutely crucial. It's the world of radio waves that well basically runs
[0:10.71 - 0:10.72] Speaker: of radio waves that well basically runs
[0:10.72 - 0:11.75] Speaker: of radio waves that well basically runs our modern lives.
[0:11.75 - 0:11.76] Speaker: our modern lives.
[0:11.76 - 0:13.19] Speaker: our modern lives. &gt;&gt; It really does. Everything from your
[0:13.19 - 0:13.20] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It really does. Everything from your
[0:13.20 - 0:15.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It really does. Everything from your Wi-Fi, your mobile phone connection,
[0:15.43 - 0:15.44] Speaker: Wi-Fi, your mobile phone connection,
[0:15.44 - 0:17.83] Speaker: Wi-Fi, your mobile phone connection, Bluetooth. It's all happening on these
[0:17.83 - 0:17.84] Speaker: Bluetooth. It's all happening on these
[0:17.84 - 0:19.51] Speaker: Bluetooth. It's all happening on these uh these air waves.
[0:19.51 - 0:19.52] Speaker: uh these air waves.
[0:19.52 - 0:21.35] Speaker: uh these air waves. &gt;&gt; Exactly. But here's the thing, and this
[0:21.35 - 0:21.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. But here's the thing, and this
[0:21.36 - 0:22.47] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. But here's the thing, and this is what kind of grabs you. These
[0:22.47 - 0:22.48] Speaker: is what kind of grabs you. These
[0:22.48 - 0:25.11] Speaker: is what kind of grabs you. These airwaves or the radio frequency spectrum
[0:25.11 - 0:25.12] Speaker: airwaves or the radio frequency spectrum
[0:25.12 - 0:26.87] Speaker: airwaves or the radio frequency spectrum technically speaking, they're not
[0:26.87 - 0:26.88] Speaker: technically speaking, they're not
[0:26.88 - 0:28.71] Speaker: technically speaking, they're not infinite. Not at all.
[0:28.71 - 0:28.72] Speaker: infinite. Not at all.
[0:28.72 - 0:30.55] Speaker: infinite. Not at all. &gt;&gt; Far from it. It's a finite resource,
[0:30.55 - 0:30.56] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Far from it. It's a finite resource,
[0:30.56 - 0:32.47] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Far from it. It's a finite resource, incredibly valuable, and most of it is
[0:32.47 - 0:32.48] Speaker: incredibly valuable, and most of it is
[0:32.48 - 0:33.59] Speaker: incredibly valuable, and most of it is already licensed out,
[0:33.59 - 0:33.60] Speaker: already licensed out,
[0:33.60 - 0:35.43] Speaker: already licensed out, &gt;&gt; right? Licensed. But here's the paradox,
[0:35.43 - 0:35.44] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right? Licensed. But here's the paradox,
[0:35.44 - 0:37.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right? Licensed. But here's the paradox, isn't it? A lot of this licensed
[0:37.43 - 0:37.44] Speaker: isn't it? A lot of this licensed
[0:37.44 - 0:39.19] Speaker: isn't it? A lot of this licensed spectrum, this sort of prime digital
[0:39.19 - 0:39.20] Speaker: spectrum, this sort of prime digital
[0:39.20 - 0:41.75] Speaker: spectrum, this sort of prime digital real estate, often just sits there
[0:41.75 - 0:41.76] Speaker: real estate, often just sits there
[0:41.76 - 0:42.79] Speaker: real estate, often just sits there underutilized.
[0:42.79 - 0:42.80] Speaker: underutilized.
[0:42.80 - 0:44.23] Speaker: underutilized. &gt;&gt; It's a huge inefficiency. Think of it
[0:44.23 - 0:44.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's a huge inefficiency. Think of it
[0:44.24 - 0:46.71] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's a huge inefficiency. Think of it like uh owning a massive skyscraper in a
[0:46.71 - 0:46.72] Speaker: like uh owning a massive skyscraper in a
[0:46.72 - 0:48.79] Speaker: like uh owning a massive skyscraper in a bustling downtown area, but keeping most
[0:48.79 - 0:48.80] Speaker: bustling downtown area, but keeping most
[0:48.80 - 0:50.63] Speaker: bustling downtown area, but keeping most of the floors completely empty most of
[0:50.63 - 0:50.64] Speaker: of the floors completely empty most of
[0:50.64 - 0:51.03] Speaker: of the floors completely empty most of the time,
[0:51.03 - 0:51.04] Speaker: the time,
[0:51.04 - 0:52.79] Speaker: the time, &gt;&gt; while everyone outside is desperate for
[0:52.79 - 0:52.80] Speaker: &gt;&gt; while everyone outside is desperate for
[0:52.80 - 0:53.59] Speaker: &gt;&gt; while everyone outside is desperate for office space.
[0:53.59 - 0:53.60] Speaker: office space.
[0:53.60 - 0:55.59] Speaker: office space. &gt;&gt; Precisely. And that scarcity, that
[0:55.59 - 0:55.60] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Precisely. And that scarcity, that
[0:55.60 - 0:58.95] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Precisely. And that scarcity, that bottleneck is a real drag on innovation,
[0:58.95 - 0:58.96] Speaker: bottleneck is a real drag on innovation,
[0:58.96 - 1:00.47] Speaker: bottleneck is a real drag on innovation, especially with how connected everything
[1:00.47 - 1:00.48] Speaker: especially with how connected everything
[1:00.48 - 1:01.27] Speaker: especially with how connected everything is becoming.
[1:01.27 - 1:01.28] Speaker: is becoming.
[1:01.28 - 1:03.19] Speaker: is becoming. &gt;&gt; Okay, so that sets the stage perfectly
[1:03.19 - 1:03.20] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, so that sets the stage perfectly
[1:03.20 - 1:06.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, so that sets the stage perfectly for our main topic, cognitive radio or
[1:06.39 - 1:06.40] Speaker: for our main topic, cognitive radio or
[1:06.40 - 1:08.31] Speaker: for our main topic, cognitive radio or CR. This is supposed to be the smart
[1:08.31 - 1:08.32] Speaker: CR. This is supposed to be the smart
[1:08.32 - 1:09.11] Speaker: CR. This is supposed to be the smart solution, right?
[1:09.11 - 1:09.12] Speaker: solution, right?
[1:09.12 - 1:11.43] Speaker: solution, right? &gt;&gt; That's the idea. Cognitive radio came
[1:11.43 - 1:11.44] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's the idea. Cognitive radio came
[1:11.44 - 1:13.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's the idea. Cognitive radio came about to tackle this very problem. It
[1:13.67 - 1:13.68] Speaker: about to tackle this very problem. It
[1:13.68 - 1:15.99] Speaker: about to tackle this very problem. It let secondary users think of them as, I
[1:15.99 - 1:16.00] Speaker: let secondary users think of them as, I
[1:16.00 - 1:18.47] Speaker: let secondary users think of them as, I don't know, opportunistic renters use
[1:18.47 - 1:18.48] Speaker: don't know, opportunistic renters use
[1:18.48 - 1:20.87] Speaker: don't know, opportunistic renters use licensed bands intelligently. But only
[1:20.87 - 1:20.88] Speaker: licensed bands intelligently. But only
[1:20.88 - 1:23.11] Speaker: licensed bands intelligently. But only when the primary users, the owners,
[1:23.11 - 1:23.12] Speaker: when the primary users, the owners,
[1:23.12 - 1:24.71] Speaker: when the primary users, the owners, aren't actually using them at that
[1:24.71 - 1:24.72] Speaker: aren't actually using them at that
[1:24.72 - 1:25.19] Speaker: aren't actually using them at that moment.
[1:25.19 - 1:25.20] Speaker: moment.
[1:25.20 - 1:27.27] Speaker: moment. &gt;&gt; Exactly. It's about smart sharing,
[1:27.27 - 1:27.28] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. It's about smart sharing,
[1:27.28 - 1:29.35] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. It's about smart sharing, getting the most out of what we have
[1:29.35 - 1:29.36] Speaker: getting the most out of what we have
[1:29.36 - 1:31.43] Speaker: getting the most out of what we have without stepping on the original owner's
[1:31.43 - 1:31.44] Speaker: without stepping on the original owner's
[1:31.44 - 1:32.15] Speaker: without stepping on the original owner's toes.
[1:32.15 - 1:32.16] Speaker: toes.
[1:32.16 - 1:34.31] Speaker: toes. &gt;&gt; For that whole system to work, for CR to
[1:34.31 - 1:34.32] Speaker: &gt;&gt; For that whole system to work, for CR to
[1:34.32 - 1:37.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; For that whole system to work, for CR to be, you know, viable, there's one
[1:37.51 - 1:37.52] Speaker: be, you know, viable, there's one
[1:37.52 - 1:38.95] Speaker: be, you know, viable, there's one absolutely critical piece.
[1:38.95 - 1:38.96] Speaker: absolutely critical piece.
[1:38.96 - 1:41.11] Speaker: absolutely critical piece. &gt;&gt; Spectrum sensing. Yeah. The secondary
[1:41.11 - 1:41.12] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Spectrum sensing. Yeah. The secondary
[1:41.12 - 1:43.03] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Spectrum sensing. Yeah. The secondary users have to know accurately whether
[1:43.03 - 1:43.04] Speaker: users have to know accurately whether
[1:43.04 - 1:45.03] Speaker: users have to know accurately whether the primary user is transmitting or not.
[1:45.03 - 1:45.04] Speaker: the primary user is transmitting or not.
[1:45.04 - 1:46.87] Speaker: the primary user is transmitting or not. &gt;&gt; It's the absolute foundation, isn't it?
[1:46.87 - 1:46.88] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's the absolute foundation, isn't it?
[1:46.88 - 1:48.07] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's the absolute foundation, isn't it? If the sensing is off,
[1:48.07 - 1:48.08] Speaker: If the sensing is off,
[1:48.08 - 1:49.91] Speaker: If the sensing is off, &gt;&gt; chaos. You either get interference,
[1:49.91 - 1:49.92] Speaker: &gt;&gt; chaos. You either get interference,
[1:49.92 - 1:51.83] Speaker: &gt;&gt; chaos. You either get interference, which is bad news for the primary user,
[1:51.83 - 1:51.84] Speaker: which is bad news for the primary user,
[1:51.84 - 1:53.27] Speaker: which is bad news for the primary user, potentially disrupting critical
[1:53.27 - 1:53.28] Speaker: potentially disrupting critical
[1:53.28 - 1:53.83] Speaker: potentially disrupting critical services,
[1:53.83 - 1:53.84] Speaker: services,
[1:53.84 - 1:55.43] Speaker: services, &gt;&gt; or you get missed opportunities where
[1:55.43 - 1:55.44] Speaker: &gt;&gt; or you get missed opportunities where
[1:55.44 - 1:57.03] Speaker: &gt;&gt; or you get missed opportunities where the secondary user thinks the band is
[1:57.03 - 1:57.04] Speaker: the secondary user thinks the band is
[1:57.04 - 1:59.03] Speaker: the secondary user thinks the band is busy when it's actually free, defeating
[1:59.03 - 1:59.04] Speaker: busy when it's actually free, defeating
[1:59.04 - 2:00.07] Speaker: busy when it's actually free, defeating the purpose of CR.
[2:00.07 - 2:00.08] Speaker: the purpose of CR.
[2:00.08 - 2:01.99] Speaker: the purpose of CR. &gt;&gt; Right? So, this sensing has to be
[2:01.99 - 2:02.00] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Right? So, this sensing has to be
[2:02.00 - 2:03.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Right? So, this sensing has to be incredibly reliable.
[2:03.43 - 2:03.44] Speaker: incredibly reliable.
[2:03.44 - 2:05.19] Speaker: incredibly reliable. &gt;&gt; And that's the core challenge we're
[2:05.19 - 2:05.20] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And that's the core challenge we're
[2:05.20 - 2:07.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And that's the core challenge we're diving into today because traditional
[2:07.99 - 2:08.00] Speaker: diving into today because traditional
[2:08.00 - 2:10.23] Speaker: diving into today because traditional spectrum sensing methods, they really
[2:10.23 - 2:10.24] Speaker: spectrum sensing methods, they really
[2:10.24 - 2:11.59] Speaker: spectrum sensing methods, they really struggle in the real world.
[2:11.59 - 2:11.60] Speaker: struggle in the real world.
[2:11.60 - 2:14.07] Speaker: struggle in the real world. &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. We're talking low signal
[2:14.07 - 2:14.08] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. We're talking low signal
[2:14.08 - 2:16.15] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Oh, absolutely. We're talking low signal strength where the signal you're looking
[2:16.15 - 2:16.16] Speaker: strength where the signal you're looking
[2:16.16 - 2:18.23] Speaker: strength where the signal you're looking for is barely above the noise
[2:18.23 - 2:18.24] Speaker: for is barely above the noise
[2:18.24 - 2:20.47] Speaker: for is barely above the noise &gt;&gt; and the noise itself isn't stable. It's
[2:20.47 - 2:20.48] Speaker: &gt;&gt; and the noise itself isn't stable. It's
[2:20.48 - 2:22.31] Speaker: &gt;&gt; and the noise itself isn't stable. It's unpredictable. What they call noise
[2:22.31 - 2:22.32] Speaker: unpredictable. What they call noise
[2:22.32 - 2:23.27] Speaker: unpredictable. What they call noise uncertainty.
[2:23.27 - 2:23.28] Speaker: uncertainty.
[2:23.28 - 2:25.35] Speaker: uncertainty. &gt;&gt; Plus, you've got signal fading where the
[2:25.35 - 2:25.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Plus, you've got signal fading where the
[2:25.36 - 2:27.35] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Plus, you've got signal fading where the signal strength just fluctuates wildly
[2:27.35 - 2:27.36] Speaker: signal strength just fluctuates wildly
[2:27.36 - 2:29.11] Speaker: signal strength just fluctuates wildly because of the environment. These aren't
[2:29.11 - 2:29.12] Speaker: because of the environment. These aren't
[2:29.12 - 2:29.83] Speaker: because of the environment. These aren't small issues.
[2:29.83 - 2:29.84] Speaker: small issues.
[2:29.84 - 2:31.51] Speaker: small issues. &gt;&gt; Not at all. So, the research paper we're
[2:31.51 - 2:31.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Not at all. So, the research paper we're
[2:31.52 - 2:33.75] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Not at all. So, the research paper we're digging into today tackles these exact
[2:33.75 - 2:33.76] Speaker: digging into today tackles these exact
[2:33.76 - 2:35.59] Speaker: digging into today tackles these exact problems. It looks at advanced
[2:35.59 - 2:35.60] Speaker: problems. It looks at advanced
[2:35.60 - 2:37.11] Speaker: problems. It looks at advanced techniques, specifically something
[2:37.11 - 2:37.12] Speaker: techniques, specifically something
[2:37.12 - 2:39.75] Speaker: techniques, specifically something called generalized energy detectors or
[2:39.75 - 2:39.76] Speaker: called generalized energy detectors or
[2:39.76 - 2:42.31] Speaker: called generalized energy detectors or GEDs. And it really gets into the weeds
[2:42.31 - 2:42.32] Speaker: GEDs. And it really gets into the weeds
[2:42.32 - 2:44.47] Speaker: GEDs. And it really gets into the weeds on how these detectors perform under
[2:44.47 - 2:44.48] Speaker: on how these detectors perform under
[2:44.48 - 2:46.47] Speaker: on how these detectors perform under tough conditions, especially when you
[2:46.47 - 2:46.48] Speaker: tough conditions, especially when you
[2:46.48 - 2:49.03] Speaker: tough conditions, especially when you use multiple receivers. And it explores
[2:49.03 - 2:49.04] Speaker: use multiple receivers. And it explores
[2:49.04 - 2:51.51] Speaker: use multiple receivers. And it explores this really fascinating um slightly
[2:51.51 - 2:51.52] Speaker: this really fascinating um slightly
[2:51.52 - 2:53.83] Speaker: this really fascinating um slightly scary concept called the SNR wall.
[2:53.83 - 2:53.84] Speaker: scary concept called the SNR wall.
[2:53.84 - 2:57.11] Speaker: scary concept called the SNR wall. &gt;&gt; The SNR wall sounds ominous. So what are
[2:57.11 - 2:57.12] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The SNR wall sounds ominous. So what are
[2:57.12 - 2:58.79] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The SNR wall sounds ominous. So what are we hoping to uncover here? Well, we'll
[2:58.79 - 2:58.80] Speaker: we hoping to uncover here? Well, we'll
[2:58.80 - 3:00.39] Speaker: we hoping to uncover here? Well, we'll see how these fundamental noise issues
[3:00.39 - 3:00.40] Speaker: see how these fundamental noise issues
[3:00.40 - 3:02.55] Speaker: see how these fundamental noise issues can actually create hard limits, these
[3:02.55 - 3:02.56] Speaker: can actually create hard limits, these
[3:02.56 - 3:05.43] Speaker: can actually create hard limits, these walls on communication reliability,
[3:05.43 - 3:05.44] Speaker: walls on communication reliability,
[3:05.44 - 3:07.51] Speaker: walls on communication reliability, &gt;&gt; but also how clever engineering like
[3:07.51 - 3:07.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; but also how clever engineering like
[3:07.52 - 3:09.59] Speaker: &gt;&gt; but also how clever engineering like using diversity schemes can help push
[3:09.59 - 3:09.60] Speaker: using diversity schemes can help push
[3:09.60 - 3:11.27] Speaker: using diversity schemes can help push back against those limits.
[3:11.27 - 3:11.28] Speaker: back against those limits.
[3:11.28 - 3:13.03] Speaker: back against those limits. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And we might find some
[3:13.03 - 3:13.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. And we might find some
[3:13.04 - 3:14.63] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. And we might find some surprising things about what actually
[3:14.63 - 3:14.64] Speaker: surprising things about what actually
[3:14.64 - 3:16.55] Speaker: surprising things about what actually degrades performance the most in the

[3:16.56 - 3:18.23] Speaker: degrades performance the most in the real world. It challenges some common
[3:18.23 - 3:18.24] Speaker: real world. It challenges some common
[3:18.24 - 3:19.11] Speaker: real world. It challenges some common assumptions.
[3:19.11 - 3:19.12] Speaker: assumptions.
[3:19.12 - 3:21.03] Speaker: assumptions. &gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like a fascinating journey.
[3:21.03 - 3:21.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like a fascinating journey.
[3:21.04 - 3:23.03] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, sounds like a fascinating journey. Let's start with the basics then. This
[3:23.03 - 3:23.04] Speaker: Let's start with the basics then. This
[3:23.04 - 3:25.59] Speaker: Let's start with the basics then. This silent battle for bandwidth, right? This
[3:25.59 - 3:25.60] Speaker: silent battle for bandwidth, right? This
[3:25.60 - 3:27.83] Speaker: silent battle for bandwidth, right? This idea of spectrum being scarce. It can
[3:27.83 - 3:27.84] Speaker: idea of spectrum being scarce. It can
[3:27.84 - 3:30.31] Speaker: idea of spectrum being scarce. It can feel bit abstract maybe it's not like

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

[3:42.23 - 3:42.24] Speaker: TV broadcasters, emergency services.
[3:42.24 - 3:44.63] Speaker: TV broadcasters, emergency services. They've paid for exclusive rights to use
[3:44.63 - 3:44.64] Speaker: They've paid for exclusive rights to use
[3:44.64 - 3:46.31] Speaker: They've paid for exclusive rights to use specific chunks of spectrum
[3:46.31 - 3:46.32] Speaker: specific chunks of spectrum
[3:46.32 - 3:48.07] Speaker: specific chunks of spectrum &gt;&gt; like owning plots of land but in the
[3:48.07 - 3:48.08] Speaker: &gt;&gt; like owning plots of land but in the
[3:48.08 - 3:48.71] Speaker: &gt;&gt; like owning plots of land but in the airwaves.
[3:48.71 - 3:48.72] Speaker: airwaves.
[3:48.72 - 3:51.03] Speaker: airwaves. &gt;&gt; A good analogy. But then studies
[3:51.03 - 3:51.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; A good analogy. But then studies
[3:51.04 - 3:52.71] Speaker: &gt;&gt; A good analogy. But then studies consistently show that much of this
[3:52.71 - 3:52.72] Speaker: consistently show that much of this
[3:52.72 - 3:55.99] Speaker: consistently show that much of this licensed land is well empty a lot of the
[3:55.99 - 3:56.00] Speaker: licensed land is well empty a lot of the
[3:56.00 - 3:57.35] Speaker: licensed land is well empty a lot of the time, underutilized,
[3:57.35 - 3:57.36] Speaker: time, underutilized,
[3:57.36 - 3:59.11] Speaker: time, underutilized, &gt;&gt; which seems incredibly wasteful.
[3:59.11 - 3:59.12] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which seems incredibly wasteful.
[3:59.12 - 4:00.95] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which seems incredibly wasteful. &gt;&gt; It is. It's like having a massive
[4:00.95 - 4:00.96] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It is. It's like having a massive
[4:00.96 - 4:03.75] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It is. It's like having a massive highway with say 20 lanes but only ever
[4:03.75 - 4:03.76] Speaker: highway with say 20 lanes but only ever
[4:03.76 - 4:05.35] Speaker: highway with say 20 lanes but only ever using three or four while the entrance
[4:05.35 - 4:05.36] Speaker: using three or four while the entrance
[4:05.36 - 4:07.03] Speaker: using three or four while the entrance ramps are totally gridlocked.
[4:07.03 - 4:07.04] Speaker: ramps are totally gridlocked.
[4:07.04 - 4:08.63] Speaker: ramps are totally gridlocked. &gt;&gt; That's a powerful image. And that
[4:08.63 - 4:08.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a powerful image. And that
[4:08.64 - 4:10.79] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a powerful image. And that gridlock, that bottleneck directly
[4:10.79 - 4:10.80] Speaker: gridlock, that bottleneck directly
[4:10.80 - 4:12.23] Speaker: gridlock, that bottleneck directly impacts us, right? It slows down
[4:12.23 - 4:12.24] Speaker: impacts us, right? It slows down
[4:12.24 - 4:13.11] Speaker: impacts us, right? It slows down innovation.
[4:13.11 - 4:13.12] Speaker: innovation.
[4:13.12 - 4:15.19] Speaker: innovation. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Think about the explosion in
[4:15.19 - 4:15.20] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Think about the explosion in
[4:15.20 - 4:17.11] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Think about the explosion in wireless demand. More devices, faster
[4:17.11 - 4:17.12] Speaker: wireless demand. More devices, faster
[4:17.12 - 4:19.75] Speaker: wireless demand. More devices, faster speeds, the internet of things, 5G. It
[4:19.75 - 4:19.76] Speaker: speeds, the internet of things, 5G. It
[4:19.76 - 4:21.67] Speaker: speeds, the internet of things, 5G. It all needs spectrum. Yeah. If chunks of
[4:21.67 - 4:21.68] Speaker: all needs spectrum. Yeah. If chunks of
[4:21.68 - 4:24.07] Speaker: all needs spectrum. Yeah. If chunks of it are locked away and unused, it holds
[4:24.07 - 4:24.08] Speaker: it are locked away and unused, it holds
[4:24.08 - 4:24.95] Speaker: it are locked away and unused, it holds everything back.
[4:24.95 - 4:24.96] Speaker: everything back.
[4:24.96 - 4:27.03] Speaker: everything back. &gt;&gt; So, it's an economic issue, a societal
[4:27.03 - 4:27.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, it's an economic issue, a societal
[4:27.04 - 4:28.87] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, it's an economic issue, a societal issue, not just a technical one. We need
[4:28.87 - 4:28.88] Speaker: issue, not just a technical one. We need
[4:28.88 - 4:30.95] Speaker: issue, not just a technical one. We need more capacity. And just building more
[4:30.95 - 4:30.96] Speaker: more capacity. And just building more
[4:30.96 - 4:33.11] Speaker: more capacity. And just building more lanes isn't always feasible or
[4:33.11 - 4:33.12] Speaker: lanes isn't always feasible or
[4:33.12 - 4:33.83] Speaker: lanes isn't always feasible or efficient.
[4:33.83 - 4:33.84] Speaker: efficient.
[4:33.84 - 4:35.43] Speaker: efficient. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's where cognitive
[4:35.43 - 4:35.44] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's where cognitive
[4:35.44 - 4:37.11] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. And that's where cognitive radio comes in as such an elegant
[4:37.11 - 4:37.12] Speaker: radio comes in as such an elegant
[4:37.12 - 4:38.47] Speaker: radio comes in as such an elegant approach. It's not about building new
[4:38.47 - 4:38.48] Speaker: approach. It's not about building new
[4:38.48 - 4:40.63] Speaker: approach. It's not about building new highways. It's about intelligently using
[4:40.63 - 4:40.64] Speaker: highways. It's about intelligently using
[4:40.64 - 4:42.55] Speaker: highways. It's about intelligently using the empty lanes on the existing ones,
[4:42.55 - 4:42.56] Speaker: the empty lanes on the existing ones,
[4:42.56 - 4:44.63] Speaker: the empty lanes on the existing ones, &gt;&gt; letting those secondary users slip in
[4:44.63 - 4:44.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; letting those secondary users slip in
[4:44.64 - 4:46.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; letting those secondary users slip in when the primary user isn't there.
[4:46.39 - 4:46.40] Speaker: when the primary user isn't there.
[4:46.40 - 4:48.07] Speaker: when the primary user isn't there. &gt;&gt; Right? And this becomes absolutely
[4:48.07 - 4:48.08] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Right? And this becomes absolutely
[4:48.08 - 4:49.91] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Right? And this becomes absolutely fundamental for future tech. The paper
[4:49.91 - 4:49.92] Speaker: fundamental for future tech. The paper
[4:49.92 - 4:51.35] Speaker: fundamental for future tech. The paper highlights things like the internet of
[4:51.35 - 4:51.36] Speaker: highlights things like the internet of
[4:51.36 - 4:53.35] Speaker: highlights things like the internet of things, IoT and 5G.
[4:53.35 - 4:53.36] Speaker: things, IoT and 5G.
[4:53.36 - 4:55.59] Speaker: things, IoT and 5G. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's connect that. Why are IoT
[4:55.59 - 4:55.60] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, let's connect that. Why are IoT
[4:55.60 - 4:57.59] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, let's connect that. Why are IoT and 5G particularly dependent on this
[4:57.59 - 4:57.60] Speaker: and 5G particularly dependent on this
[4:57.60 - 5:00.47] Speaker: and 5G particularly dependent on this kind of smart spectrum use? What's
[5:00.47 - 5:00.48] Speaker: kind of smart spectrum use? What's
[5:00.48 - 5:01.43] Speaker: kind of smart spectrum use? What's different about them?
[5:01.43 - 5:01.44] Speaker: different about them?
[5:01.44 - 5:04.55] Speaker: different about them? &gt;&gt; It really boils down to scale and uh
[5:04.55 - 5:04.56] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It really boils down to scale and uh
[5:04.56 - 5:06.63] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It really boils down to scale and uh flexibility. Take IoT. You're
[5:06.63 - 5:06.64] Speaker: flexibility. Take IoT. You're
[5:06.64 - 5:08.87] Speaker: flexibility. Take IoT. You're potentially talking billions, maybe
[5:08.87 - 5:08.88] Speaker: potentially talking billions, maybe
[5:08.88 - 5:10.95] Speaker: potentially talking billions, maybe trillions of devices.
[5:10.95 - 5:10.96] Speaker: trillions of devices.
[5:10.96 - 5:13.27] Speaker: trillions of devices. &gt;&gt; Many of them, like sensors, might only
[5:13.27 - 5:13.28] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Many of them, like sensors, might only
[5:13.28 - 5:15.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Many of them, like sensors, might only need to transmit tiny bits of data very
[5:15.43 - 5:15.44] Speaker: need to transmit tiny bits of data very
[5:15.44 - 5:17.67] Speaker: need to transmit tiny bits of data very infrequently. once an hour, once a day.
[5:17.67 - 5:17.68] Speaker: infrequently. once an hour, once a day.
[5:17.68 - 5:19.67] Speaker: infrequently. once an hour, once a day. &gt;&gt; Giving each one a dedicated frequency
[5:19.67 - 5:19.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Giving each one a dedicated frequency
[5:19.68 - 5:21.59] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Giving each one a dedicated frequency would be insanely wasteful.
[5:21.59 - 5:21.60] Speaker: would be insanely wasteful.
[5:21.60 - 5:23.75] Speaker: would be insanely wasteful. &gt;&gt; Unsustainable. CR lets them just grab a
[5:23.75 - 5:23.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Unsustainable. CR lets them just grab a
[5:23.76 - 5:25.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Unsustainable. CR lets them just grab a free slot when they need it, share the
[5:25.43 - 5:25.44] Speaker: free slot when they need it, share the
[5:25.44 - 5:26.55] Speaker: free slot when they need it, share the space efficiently.
[5:26.55 - 5:26.56] Speaker: space efficiently.
[5:26.56 - 5:28.63] Speaker: space efficiently. &gt;&gt; Makes sense. And 5G,
[5:28.63 - 5:28.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Makes sense. And 5G,
[5:28.64 - 5:30.95] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Makes sense. And 5G, &gt;&gt; 5G is all about supporting hugely
[5:30.95 - 5:30.96] Speaker: &gt;&gt; 5G is all about supporting hugely
[5:30.96 - 5:33.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; 5G is all about supporting hugely diverse applications simultaneously.
[5:33.19 - 5:33.20] Speaker: diverse applications simultaneously.
[5:33.20 - 5:35.43] Speaker: diverse applications simultaneously. You've got massive data rates for
[5:35.43 - 5:35.44] Speaker: You've got massive data rates for
[5:35.44 - 5:37.43] Speaker: You've got massive data rates for phones, super low latency for things
[5:37.43 - 5:37.44] Speaker: phones, super low latency for things
[5:37.44 - 5:39.35] Speaker: phones, super low latency for things like remote surgery or self-driving
[5:39.35 - 5:39.36] Speaker: like remote surgery or self-driving
[5:39.36 - 5:41.91] Speaker: like remote surgery or self-driving cars, and connecting vast numbers of
[5:41.91 - 5:41.92] Speaker: cars, and connecting vast numbers of
[5:41.92 - 5:44.07] Speaker: cars, and connecting vast numbers of simple devices. So it needs access to a
[5:44.07 - 5:44.08] Speaker: simple devices. So it needs access to a
[5:44.08 - 5:45.43] Speaker: simple devices. So it needs access to a lot of different types of spectrum
[5:45.43 - 5:45.44] Speaker: lot of different types of spectrum
[5:45.44 - 5:46.15] Speaker: lot of different types of spectrum flexibly.
[5:46.15 - 5:46.16] Speaker: flexibly.
[5:46.16 - 5:48.23] Speaker: flexibly. &gt;&gt; Exactly. It needs to dynamically access
[5:48.23 - 5:48.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. It needs to dynamically access
[5:48.24 - 5:51.11] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. It needs to dynamically access spectrum across low, mid, and high bands
[5:51.11 - 5:51.12] Speaker: spectrum across low, mid, and high bands
[5:51.12 - 5:53.35] Speaker: spectrum across low, mid, and high bands depending on the need. CR principles
[5:53.35 - 5:53.36] Speaker: depending on the need. CR principles
[5:53.36 - 5:55.27] Speaker: depending on the need. CR principles allow 5G networks to be much more
[5:55.27 - 5:55.28] Speaker: allow 5G networks to be much more
[5:55.28 - 5:56.95] Speaker: allow 5G networks to be much more adaptable and efficient in grabbing
[5:56.95 - 5:56.96] Speaker: adaptable and efficient in grabbing
[5:56.96 - 5:58.55] Speaker: adaptable and efficient in grabbing whatever spectrum is available and
[5:58.55 - 5:58.56] Speaker: whatever spectrum is available and
[5:58.56 - 6:00.71] Speaker: whatever spectrum is available and suitable at that moment. If a TV channel
[6:00.71 - 6:00.72] Speaker: suitable at that moment. If a TV channel
[6:00.72 - 6:02.87] Speaker: suitable at that moment. If a TV channel is off air in a certain region at night,
[6:02.87 - 6:02.88] Speaker: is off air in a certain region at night,
[6:02.88 - 6:05.43] Speaker: is off air in a certain region at night, &gt;&gt; why let that spectrum sit idle when a 5G
[6:05.43 - 6:05.44] Speaker: &gt;&gt; why let that spectrum sit idle when a 5G
[6:05.44 - 6:07.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; why let that spectrum sit idle when a 5G network could use it temporarily?
[6:07.19 - 6:07.20] Speaker: network could use it temporarily?
[6:07.20 - 6:09.11] Speaker: network could use it temporarily? &gt;&gt; Precisely. It's about dynamic
[6:09.11 - 6:09.12] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Precisely. It's about dynamic
[6:09.12 - 6:10.79] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Precisely. It's about dynamic intelligent utilization.
[6:10.79 - 6:10.80] Speaker: intelligent utilization.
[6:10.80 - 6:12.39] Speaker: intelligent utilization. &gt;&gt; Okay. It clearly makes a ton of sense
[6:12.39 - 6:12.40] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. It clearly makes a ton of sense
[6:12.40 - 6:14.71] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. It clearly makes a ton of sense from an efficiency perspective, but as
[6:14.71 - 6:14.72] Speaker: from an efficiency perspective, but as
[6:14.72 - 6:16.31] Speaker: from an efficiency perspective, but as you said earlier, the whole thing hinges
[6:16.31 - 6:16.32] Speaker: you said earlier, the whole thing hinges
[6:16.32 - 6:18.63] Speaker: you said earlier, the whole thing hinges entirely on that one crucial step,
[6:18.63 - 6:18.64] Speaker: entirely on that one crucial step,
[6:18.64 - 6:19.59] Speaker: entirely on that one crucial step, spectrum sensing.
[6:19.59 - 6:19.60] Speaker: spectrum sensing.
[6:19.60 - 6:21.67] Speaker: spectrum sensing. &gt;&gt; It's the gatekeeper. The secondary user
[6:21.67 - 6:21.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's the gatekeeper. The secondary user
[6:21.68 - 6:23.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's the gatekeeper. The secondary user has to know if the primary user is there
[6:23.43 - 6:23.44] Speaker: has to know if the primary user is there
[6:23.44 - 6:24.23] Speaker: has to know if the primary user is there or not.
[6:24.23 - 6:24.24] Speaker: or not.
[6:24.24 - 6:26.87] Speaker: or not. &gt;&gt; And if that sensing is wrong, we touched
[6:26.87 - 6:26.88] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And if that sensing is wrong, we touched
[6:26.88 - 6:28.95] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And if that sensing is wrong, we touched on this, but let's reiterate the stakes.
[6:28.95 - 6:28.96] Speaker: on this, but let's reiterate the stakes.
[6:28.96 - 6:31.43] Speaker: on this, but let's reiterate the stakes. &gt;&gt; The stakes are high. A false negative
[6:31.43 - 6:31.44] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The stakes are high. A false negative
[6:31.44 - 6:33.27] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The stakes are high. A false negative thinking the band is free when it's not
[6:33.27 - 6:33.28] Speaker: thinking the band is free when it's not
[6:33.28 - 6:35.27] Speaker: thinking the band is free when it's not causes harmful interference. Imagine
[6:35.27 - 6:35.28] Speaker: causes harmful interference. Imagine
[6:35.28 - 6:37.11] Speaker: causes harmful interference. Imagine jamming an emergency frequency or
[6:37.11 - 6:37.12] Speaker: jamming an emergency frequency or
[6:37.12 - 6:39.67] Speaker: jamming an emergency frequency or messing up air traffic control signals.
[6:39.67 - 6:39.68] Speaker: messing up air traffic control signals.
[6:39.68 - 6:41.59] Speaker: messing up air traffic control signals. Not good. Definitely not good.
[6:41.59 - 6:41.60] Speaker: Not good. Definitely not good.
[6:41.60 - 6:43.51] Speaker: Not good. Definitely not good. &gt;&gt; And a false positive thinking the band
[6:43.51 - 6:43.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And a false positive thinking the band
[6:43.52 - 6:45.27] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And a false positive thinking the band is occupied when it's actually free
[6:45.27 - 6:45.28] Speaker: is occupied when it's actually free
[6:45.28 - 6:47.59] Speaker: is occupied when it's actually free means a missed opportunity. The
[6:47.59 - 6:47.60] Speaker: means a missed opportunity. The
[6:47.60 - 6:49.51] Speaker: means a missed opportunity. The secondary user doesn't transmit. And
[6:49.51 - 6:49.52] Speaker: secondary user doesn't transmit. And
[6:49.52 - 6:51.19] Speaker: secondary user doesn't transmit. And we're back to that same problem of
[6:51.19 - 6:51.20] Speaker: we're back to that same problem of
[6:51.20 - 6:52.95] Speaker: we're back to that same problem of underutilized spectrum.
[6:52.95 - 6:52.96] Speaker: underutilized spectrum.
[6:52.96 - 6:55.27] Speaker: underutilized spectrum. &gt;&gt; So the sensing needs to be incredibly
[6:55.27 - 6:55.28] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So the sensing needs to be incredibly
[6:55.28 - 6:58.07] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So the sensing needs to be incredibly accurate, not too sensitive, not
[6:58.07 - 6:58.08] Speaker: accurate, not too sensitive, not
[6:58.08 - 6:59.75] Speaker: accurate, not too sensitive, not insensitive,
[6:59.75 - 6:59.76] Speaker: insensitive,
[6:59.76 - 7:00.87] Speaker: insensitive, just right.
[7:00.87 - 7:00.88] Speaker: just right.
[7:00.88 - 7:03.35] Speaker: just right. &gt;&gt; Exactly. The margin for error is razor
[7:03.35 - 7:03.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. The margin for error is razor
[7:03.36 - 7:04.87] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. The margin for error is razor thin. It's a really challenging
[7:04.87 - 7:04.88] Speaker: thin. It's a really challenging
[7:04.88 - 7:05.83] Speaker: thin. It's a really challenging detection problem.
[7:05.83 - 7:05.84] Speaker: detection problem.
[7:05.84 - 7:07.91] Speaker: detection problem. &gt;&gt; Okay, so sensing is key. How do we
[7:07.91 - 7:07.92] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, so sensing is key. How do we
[7:07.92 - 7:09.83] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, so sensing is key. How do we actually do it? Let's start with the
[7:09.83 - 7:09.84] Speaker: actually do it? Let's start with the
[7:09.84 - 7:11.19] Speaker: actually do it? Let's start with the most common, maybe the simplest
[7:11.19 - 7:11.20] Speaker: most common, maybe the simplest
[7:11.20 - 7:13.59] Speaker: most common, maybe the simplest approach, energy detection or ED.
[7:13.59 - 7:13.60] Speaker: approach, energy detection or ED.
[7:13.60 - 7:16.23] Speaker: approach, energy detection or ED. &gt;&gt; Right? ED is popular mainly because it's
[7:16.23 - 7:16.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Right? ED is popular mainly because it's
[7:16.24 - 7:18.15] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Right? ED is popular mainly because it's relatively easy to implement. And
[7:18.15 - 7:18.16] Speaker: relatively easy to implement. And
[7:18.16 - 7:19.43] Speaker: relatively easy to implement. And crucially, you don't need to know
[7:19.43 - 7:19.44] Speaker: crucially, you don't need to know
[7:19.44 - 7:21.35] Speaker: crucially, you don't need to know anything specific about the primary user

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

[7:21.35 - 7:21.36] Speaker: anything specific about the primary user
[7:21.36 - 7:22.39] Speaker: anything specific about the primary user signal beforehand.
[7:22.39 - 7:22.40] Speaker: signal beforehand.
[7:22.40 - 7:23.99] Speaker: signal beforehand. &gt;&gt; You don't need its fingerprint, so to
[7:23.99 - 7:24.00] Speaker: &gt;&gt; You don't need its fingerprint, so to
[7:24.00 - 7:24.63] Speaker: &gt;&gt; You don't need its fingerprint, so to speak.
[7:24.63 - 7:24.64] Speaker: speak.
[7:24.64 - 7:26.55] Speaker: speak. &gt;&gt; Exactly. No need to know its modulation
[7:26.55 - 7:26.56] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. No need to know its modulation
[7:26.56 - 7:28.47] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. No need to know its modulation type, data rate, anything like that. It
[7:28.47 - 7:28.48] Speaker: type, data rate, anything like that. It
[7:28.48 - 7:30.47] Speaker: type, data rate, anything like that. It just measures the total energy in the
[7:30.47 - 7:30.48] Speaker: just measures the total energy in the
[7:30.48 - 7:32.23] Speaker: just measures the total energy in the frequency band over a certain time
[7:32.23 - 7:32.24] Speaker: frequency band over a certain time
[7:32.24 - 7:33.75] Speaker: frequency band over a certain time &gt;&gt; and compares it to a threshold.
[7:33.75 - 7:33.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; and compares it to a threshold.
[7:33.76 - 7:36.07] Speaker: &gt;&gt; and compares it to a threshold. &gt;&gt; Yep. If the energy is above a preset
[7:36.07 - 7:36.08] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yep. If the energy is above a preset
[7:36.08 - 7:38.15] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yep. If the energy is above a preset threshold, it assumes the primary user
[7:38.15 - 7:38.16] Speaker: threshold, it assumes the primary user
[7:38.16 - 7:40.39] Speaker: threshold, it assumes the primary user is present. Below the threshold, it
[7:40.39 - 7:40.40] Speaker: is present. Below the threshold, it
[7:40.40 - 7:41.91] Speaker: is present. Below the threshold, it assumes the band is free.
[7:41.91 - 7:41.92] Speaker: assumes the band is free.
[7:41.92 - 7:44.23] Speaker: assumes the band is free. &gt;&gt; It's like listening in a quiet room. You
[7:44.23 - 7:44.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's like listening in a quiet room. You
[7:44.24 - 7:46.31] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's like listening in a quiet room. You don't care what the sound is, just if
[7:46.31 - 7:46.32] Speaker: don't care what the sound is, just if
[7:46.32 - 7:47.91] Speaker: don't care what the sound is, just if there's enough sound energy to say
[7:47.91 - 7:47.92] Speaker: there's enough sound energy to say
[7:47.92 - 7:49.11] Speaker: there's enough sound energy to say someone's likely there.
[7:49.11 - 7:49.12] Speaker: someone's likely there.
[7:49.12 - 7:51.27] Speaker: someone's likely there. &gt;&gt; That's a great analogy. Simple presence
[7:51.27 - 7:51.28] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a great analogy. Simple presence
[7:51.28 - 7:53.75] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a great analogy. Simple presence or absence based purely on energy level.
[7:53.75 - 7:53.76] Speaker: or absence based purely on energy level.
[7:53.76 - 7:55.67] Speaker: or absence based purely on energy level. &gt;&gt; But simple often comes with a catch,
[7:55.67 - 7:55.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; But simple often comes with a catch,
[7:55.68 - 7:58.15] Speaker: &gt;&gt; But simple often comes with a catch, right? What's the downside of ED?
[7:58.15 - 7:58.16] Speaker: right? What's the downside of ED?
[7:58.16 - 8:00.39] Speaker: right? What's the downside of ED? &gt;&gt; The big catch is its performance. It
[8:00.39 - 8:00.40] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The big catch is its performance. It
[8:00.40 - 8:02.23] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The big catch is its performance. It really struggles sometimes fails
[8:02.23 - 8:02.24] Speaker: really struggles sometimes fails
[8:02.24 - 8:04.63] Speaker: really struggles sometimes fails completely under challenging real world
[8:04.63 - 8:04.64] Speaker: completely under challenging real world
[8:04.64 - 8:05.19] Speaker: completely under challenging real world conditions
[8:05.19 - 8:05.20] Speaker: conditions
[8:05.20 - 8:06.63] Speaker: conditions &gt;&gt; like the ones we mentioned earlier.
[8:06.63 - 8:06.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; like the ones we mentioned earlier.
[8:06.64 - 8:09.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; like the ones we mentioned earlier. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Low signal to noise ratio or
[8:09.51 - 8:09.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. Low signal to noise ratio or
[8:09.52 - 8:11.59] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. Low signal to noise ratio or SNR where the signal is weak compared to
[8:11.59 - 8:11.60] Speaker: SNR where the signal is weak compared to
[8:11.60 - 8:13.75] Speaker: SNR where the signal is weak compared to the background noise. Noise uncertainty
[8:13.75 - 8:13.76] Speaker: the background noise. Noise uncertainty
[8:13.76 - 8:15.27] Speaker: the background noise. Noise uncertainty where that noise level itself is
[8:15.27 - 8:15.28] Speaker: where that noise level itself is
[8:15.28 - 8:18.07] Speaker: where that noise level itself is fluctuating and unpredictable and fading
[8:18.07 - 8:18.08] Speaker: fluctuating and unpredictable and fading
[8:18.08 - 8:20.79] Speaker: fluctuating and unpredictable and fading where the signal strength dips or varies
[8:20.79 - 8:20.80] Speaker: where the signal strength dips or varies
[8:20.80 - 8:21.51] Speaker: where the signal strength dips or varies wildly.
[8:21.51 - 8:21.52] Speaker: wildly.
[8:21.52 - 8:24.31] Speaker: wildly. &gt;&gt; So in those common messy scenarios, ED
[8:24.31 - 8:24.32] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So in those common messy scenarios, ED
[8:24.32 - 8:25.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So in those common messy scenarios, ED just isn't reliable enough.
[8:25.99 - 8:26.00] Speaker: just isn't reliable enough.
[8:26.00 - 8:28.31] Speaker: just isn't reliable enough. &gt;&gt; Often no. it becomes very prone to
[8:28.31 - 8:28.32] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Often no. it becomes very prone to
[8:28.32 - 8:30.07] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Often no. it becomes very prone to making errors either missing weak
[8:30.07 - 8:30.08] Speaker: making errors either missing weak
[8:30.08 - 8:32.71] Speaker: making errors either missing weak signals or falsely detecting noise as a
[8:32.71 - 8:32.72] Speaker: signals or falsely detecting noise as a
[8:32.72 - 8:33.27] Speaker: signals or falsely detecting noise as a signal.
[8:33.27 - 8:33.28] Speaker: signal.
[8:33.28 - 8:35.03] Speaker: signal. &gt;&gt; Which brings us to the next step in the
[8:35.03 - 8:35.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Which brings us to the next step in the
[8:35.04 - 8:37.91] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Which brings us to the next step in the evolution, the generalized energy
[8:37.91 - 8:37.92] Speaker: evolution, the generalized energy
[8:37.92 - 8:41.03] Speaker: evolution, the generalized energy detector or GED. This is where the madic
[8:41.03 - 8:41.04] Speaker: detector or GED. This is where the madic
[8:41.04 - 8:42.31] Speaker: detector or GED. This is where the madic gets a bit more flexible. Right?
[8:42.31 - 8:42.32] Speaker: gets a bit more flexible. Right?
[8:42.32 - 8:43.67] Speaker: gets a bit more flexible. Right? &gt;&gt; It does. And this is where the paper
[8:43.67 - 8:43.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It does. And this is where the paper
[8:43.68 - 8:46.07] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It does. And this is where the paper really starts to dig in. GED builds on
[8:46.07 - 8:46.08] Speaker: really starts to dig in. GED builds on
[8:46.08 - 8:48.55] Speaker: really starts to dig in. GED builds on ED but makes one key change. Instead of
[8:48.55 - 8:48.56] Speaker: ED but makes one key change. Instead of
[8:48.56 - 8:50.39] Speaker: ED but makes one key change. Instead of just squaring the received signal
[8:50.39 - 8:50.40] Speaker: just squaring the received signal
[8:50.40 - 8:51.03] Speaker: just squaring the received signal amplitude,
[8:51.03 - 8:51.04] Speaker: amplitude,
[8:51.04 - 8:52.63] Speaker: amplitude, &gt;&gt; which is effectively raising it to the
[8:52.63 - 8:52.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which is effectively raising it to the
[8:52.64 - 8:53.35] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which is effectively raising it to the power of two,
[8:53.35 - 8:53.36] Speaker: power of two,
[8:53.36 - 8:55.59] Speaker: power of two, &gt;&gt; right? The GED replaces that fixed power
[8:55.59 - 8:55.60] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right? The GED replaces that fixed power
[8:55.60 - 8:57.75] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right? The GED replaces that fixed power of two with an arbitrary positive
[8:57.75 - 8:57.76] Speaker: of two with an arbitrary positive
[8:57.76 - 8:59.83] Speaker: of two with an arbitrary positive exponent which they call P. So it's
[8:59.83 - 8:59.84] Speaker: exponent which they call P. So it's
[8:59.84 - 9:01.75] Speaker: exponent which they call P. So it's sometimes called a P norm detector.
[9:01.75 - 9:01.76] Speaker: sometimes called a P norm detector.
[9:01.76 - 9:03.99] Speaker: sometimes called a P norm detector. &gt;&gt; So the standard ED is just a GED where
[9:03.99 - 9:04.00] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So the standard ED is just a GED where
[9:04.00 - 9:04.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So the standard ED is just a GED where P2
[9:04.55 - 9:04.56] Speaker: P2
[9:04.56 - 9:06.23] Speaker: P2 &gt;&gt; precisely. And the big deal is this
[9:06.23 - 9:06.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; precisely. And the big deal is this
[9:06.24 - 9:08.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; precisely. And the big deal is this flexibility in P. Previous research
[9:08.55 - 9:08.56] Speaker: flexibility in P. Previous research
[9:08.56 - 9:10.15] Speaker: flexibility in P. Previous research which this paper acknowledges found that
[9:10.15 - 9:10.16] Speaker: which this paper acknowledges found that
[9:10.16 - 9:12.63] Speaker: which this paper acknowledges found that choosing a different P maybe 1.5 or 2.5
[9:12.63 - 9:12.64] Speaker: choosing a different P maybe 1.5 or 2.5
[9:12.64 - 9:14.95] Speaker: choosing a different P maybe 1.5 or 2.5 or 3.3 could actually improve detection
[9:14.95 - 9:14.96] Speaker: or 3.3 could actually improve detection
[9:14.96 - 9:16.55] Speaker: or 3.3 could actually improve detection performance in certain situations
[9:16.55 - 9:16.56] Speaker: performance in certain situations
[9:16.56 - 9:18.15] Speaker: performance in certain situations compared to just using P2.
[9:18.15 - 9:18.16] Speaker: compared to just using P2.
[9:18.16 - 9:20.15] Speaker: compared to just using P2. &gt;&gt; Huh. So just tweaking that exponent
[9:20.15 - 9:20.16] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Huh. So just tweaking that exponent
[9:20.16 - 9:21.91] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Huh. So just tweaking that exponent gives you a potential advantage. How
[9:21.91 - 9:21.92] Speaker: gives you a potential advantage. How
[9:21.92 - 9:24.15] Speaker: gives you a potential advantage. How does that work intuitively? Why would
[9:24.15 - 9:24.16] Speaker: does that work intuitively? Why would
[9:24.16 - 9:26.71] Speaker: does that work intuitively? Why would raising the signal to the power of say
[9:26.71 - 9:26.72] Speaker: raising the signal to the power of say
[9:26.72 - 9:28.31] Speaker: raising the signal to the power of say three instead of two help?
[9:28.31 - 9:28.32] Speaker: three instead of two help?
[9:28.32 - 9:30.63] Speaker: three instead of two help? &gt;&gt; That's a really good question. It
[9:30.63 - 9:30.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a really good question. It
[9:30.64 - 9:32.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a really good question. It changes how the detector weighs
[9:32.55 - 9:32.56] Speaker: changes how the detector weighs
[9:32.56 - 9:34.87] Speaker: changes how the detector weighs different parts of the signal energy.
[9:34.87 - 9:34.88] Speaker: different parts of the signal energy.
[9:34.88 - 9:37.75] Speaker: different parts of the signal energy. Think about it. Squaring P2 gives
[9:37.75 - 9:37.76] Speaker: Think about it. Squaring P2 gives
[9:37.76 - 9:39.67] Speaker: Think about it. Squaring P2 gives emphasis proportional to the signal
[9:39.67 - 9:39.68] Speaker: emphasis proportional to the signal
[9:39.68 - 9:42.71] Speaker: emphasis proportional to the signal strength. A higher P like P3 gives much
[9:42.71 - 9:42.72] Speaker: strength. A higher P like P3 gives much
[9:42.72 - 9:44.39] Speaker: strength. A higher P like P3 gives much more weight to the stronger parts of the
[9:44.39 - 9:44.40] Speaker: more weight to the stronger parts of the
[9:44.40 - 9:46.63] Speaker: more weight to the stronger parts of the signal and relatively less weight to the
[9:46.63 - 9:46.64] Speaker: signal and relatively less weight to the
[9:46.64 - 9:47.67] Speaker: signal and relatively less weight to the weaker parts.
[9:47.67 - 9:47.68] Speaker: weaker parts.
[9:47.68 - 9:49.99] Speaker: weaker parts. &gt;&gt; Okay? So imagine you have a primary
[9:49.99 - 9:50.00] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay? So imagine you have a primary
[9:50.00 - 9:52.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay? So imagine you have a primary signal that's very bursty, short, strong
[9:52.39 - 9:52.40] Speaker: signal that's very bursty, short, strong
[9:52.40 - 9:54.63] Speaker: signal that's very bursty, short, strong pulses. A higher P might help the
[9:54.63 - 9:54.64] Speaker: pulses. A higher P might help the
[9:54.64 - 9:56.63] Speaker: pulses. A higher P might help the detector lock onto those strong peaks
[9:56.63 - 9:56.64] Speaker: detector lock onto those strong peaks
[9:56.64 - 9:58.55] Speaker: detector lock onto those strong peaks more effectively and distinguish them
[9:58.55 - 9:58.56] Speaker: more effectively and distinguish them
[9:58.56 - 10:00.79] Speaker: more effectively and distinguish them from lower level steadier noise.
[10:00.79 - 10:00.80] Speaker: from lower level steadier noise.
[10:00.80 - 10:02.87] Speaker: from lower level steadier noise. &gt;&gt; Ah, I see. It emphasizes the peaks.
[10:02.87 - 10:02.88] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Ah, I see. It emphasizes the peaks.
[10:02.88 - 10:04.79] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Ah, I see. It emphasizes the peaks. &gt;&gt; Or conversely, maybe a different P
[10:04.79 - 10:04.80] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Or conversely, maybe a different P
[10:04.80 - 10:06.95] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Or conversely, maybe a different P value, perhaps less than two, might be
[10:06.95 - 10:06.96] Speaker: value, perhaps less than two, might be
[10:06.96 - 10:08.71] Speaker: value, perhaps less than two, might be better for detecting very weak but
[10:08.71 - 10:08.72] Speaker: better for detecting very weak but

[11:02.24 - 11:02.79] Speaker: components, which changes with temperature,
[11:02.79 - 11:02.80] Speaker: temperature,
[11:02.80 - 11:04.95] Speaker: temperature, &gt;&gt; right? Basic physics. Then a big one,
[11:04.95 - 11:04.96] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right? Basic physics. Then a big one,
[11:04.96 - 11:07.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right? Basic physics. Then a big one, variations in the gain of the low-noise
[11:07.51 - 11:07.52] Speaker: variations in the gain of the low-noise
[11:07.52 - 11:10.07] Speaker: variations in the gain of the low-noise amplifier, the LNA. That's the first
[11:10.07 - 11:10.08] Speaker: amplifier, the LNA. That's the first
[11:10.08 - 11:12.31] Speaker: amplifier, the LNA. That's the first stage amplifying the really weak
[11:12.31 - 11:12.32] Speaker: stage amplifying the really weak
[11:12.32 - 11:14.39] Speaker: stage amplifying the really weak incoming signal. If it's amplification
[11:14.39 - 11:14.40] Speaker: incoming signal. If it's amplification
[11:14.40 - 11:15.83] Speaker: incoming signal. If it's amplification fluctuates even slightly,
[11:15.83 - 11:15.84] Speaker: fluctuates even slightly,
[11:15.84 - 11:17.75] Speaker: fluctuates even slightly, &gt;&gt; it changes the perceived noise level
[11:17.75 - 11:17.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; it changes the perceived noise level
[11:17.76 - 11:18.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; it changes the perceived noise level significantly.
[11:18.55 - 11:18.56] Speaker: significantly.
[11:18.56 - 11:20.23] Speaker: significantly. &gt;&gt; Exactly. And on top of all that, you
[11:20.23 - 11:20.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. And on top of all that, you
[11:20.24 - 11:21.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. And on top of all that, you have environmental noise interference
[11:21.99 - 11:22.00] Speaker: have environmental noise interference
[11:22.00 - 11:23.99] Speaker: have environmental noise interference from other devices, other transmissions,
[11:23.99 - 11:24.00] Speaker: from other devices, other transmissions,
[11:24.00 - 11:25.67] Speaker: from other devices, other transmissions, atmospheric noise, which is inherently
[11:25.67 - 11:25.68] Speaker: atmospheric noise, which is inherently
[11:25.68 - 11:26.23] Speaker: atmospheric noise, which is inherently dynamic.
[11:26.23 - 11:26.24] Speaker: dynamic.
[11:26.24 - 11:28.31] Speaker: dynamic. &gt;&gt; So it's not just a steady hiss, it's a
[11:28.31 - 11:28.32] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So it's not just a steady hiss, it's a
[11:28.32 - 11:30.23] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So it's not just a steady hiss, it's a complex, fluctuating background you're
[11:30.23 - 11:30.24] Speaker: complex, fluctuating background you're
[11:30.24 - 11:32.07] Speaker: complex, fluctuating background you're trying to detect a signal against.
[11:32.07 - 11:32.08] Speaker: trying to detect a signal against.
[11:32.08 - 11:34.39] Speaker: trying to detect a signal against. &gt;&gt; Precisely. And that makes setting that
[11:34.39 - 11:34.40] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Precisely. And that makes setting that
[11:34.40 - 11:35.91] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Precisely. And that makes setting that decision threshold for the energy
[11:35.91 - 11:35.92] Speaker: decision threshold for the energy
[11:35.92 - 11:38.39] Speaker: decision threshold for the energy detector incredibly difficult. If the
[11:38.39 - 11:38.40] Speaker: detector incredibly difficult. If the
[11:38.40 - 11:40.07] Speaker: detector incredibly difficult. If the noise floor itself is moving up and
[11:40.07 - 11:40.08] Speaker: noise floor itself is moving up and
[11:40.08 - 11:43.03] Speaker: noise floor itself is moving up and down, where you set the bar to reliably
[11:43.03 - 11:43.04] Speaker: down, where you set the bar to reliably
[11:43.04 - 11:45.67] Speaker: down, where you set the bar to reliably catch a real signal without constantly
[11:45.67 - 11:45.68] Speaker: catch a real signal without constantly
[11:45.68 - 11:47.83] Speaker: catch a real signal without constantly getting false alarms from noise spikes.
[11:47.83 - 11:47.84] Speaker: getting false alarms from noise spikes.
[11:47.84 - 11:49.51] Speaker: getting false alarms from noise spikes. &gt;&gt; It sounds like trying to measure ripples
[11:49.51 - 11:49.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It sounds like trying to measure ripples
[11:49.52 - 11:51.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It sounds like trying to measure ripples on the surface of a choppy sea.
[11:51.43 - 11:51.44] Speaker: on the surface of a choppy sea.
[11:51.44 - 11:53.27] Speaker: on the surface of a choppy sea. &gt;&gt; That's a good way to put it. Even if you
[11:53.27 - 11:53.28] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a good way to put it. Even if you
[11:53.28 - 11:55.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a good way to put it. Even if you sense for a really long time collect
[11:55.43 - 11:55.44] Speaker: sense for a really long time collect
[11:55.44 - 11:58.39] Speaker: sense for a really long time collect tons of data samples, this uncertainty
[11:58.39 - 11:58.40] Speaker: tons of data samples, this uncertainty
[11:58.40 - 12:00.31] Speaker: tons of data samples, this uncertainty limits your ability to make a confident
[12:00.31 - 12:00.32] Speaker: limits your ability to make a confident
[12:00.32 - 12:02.71] Speaker: limits your ability to make a confident decision. And this difficulty, this
[12:02.71 - 12:02.72] Speaker: decision. And this difficulty, this
[12:02.72 - 12:05.83] Speaker: decision. And this difficulty, this fundamental limit imposed by NU leads
[12:05.83 - 12:05.84] Speaker: fundamental limit imposed by NU leads
[12:05.84 - 12:08.07] Speaker: fundamental limit imposed by NU leads directly to this concept of the SNR
[12:08.07 - 12:08.08] Speaker: directly to this concept of the SNR
[12:08.08 - 12:08.63] Speaker: directly to this concept of the SNR wall.
[12:08.63 - 12:08.64] Speaker: wall.
[12:08.64 - 12:11.19] Speaker: wall. &gt;&gt; Yes, the SNR wall is a direct
[12:11.19 - 12:11.20] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes, the SNR wall is a direct
[12:11.20 - 12:13.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes, the SNR wall is a direct consequence of noise uncertainty. It
[12:13.51 - 12:13.52] Speaker: consequence of noise uncertainty. It
[12:13.52 - 12:15.59] Speaker: consequence of noise uncertainty. It represents a specific signal to noise
[12:15.59 - 12:15.60] Speaker: represents a specific signal to noise
[12:15.60 - 12:17.67] Speaker: represents a specific signal to noise ratio value. Below this value,
[12:17.67 - 12:17.68] Speaker: ratio value. Below this value,
[12:17.68 - 12:18.47] Speaker: ratio value. Below this value, &gt;&gt; things break down
[12:18.47 - 12:18.48] Speaker: &gt;&gt; things break down
[12:18.48 - 12:20.31] Speaker: &gt;&gt; things break down &gt;&gt; completely. Below the SNR wall, you
[12:20.31 - 12:20.32] Speaker: &gt;&gt; completely. Below the SNR wall, you
[12:20.32 - 12:21.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; completely. Below the SNR wall, you simply cannot achieve your desired
[12:21.67 - 12:21.68] Speaker: simply cannot achieve your desired
[12:21.68 - 12:23.19] Speaker: simply cannot achieve your desired detection performance. Say perfect
[12:23.19 - 12:23.20] Speaker: detection performance. Say perfect
[12:23.20 - 12:25.11] Speaker: detection performance. Say perfect detection with zero false alarms, no
[12:25.11 - 12:25.12] Speaker: detection with zero false alarms, no
[12:25.12 - 12:27.27] Speaker: detection with zero false alarms, no matter how long you sense for, even with
[12:27.27 - 12:27.28] Speaker: matter how long you sense for, even with
[12:27.28 - 12:29.43] Speaker: matter how long you sense for, even with infinite sensing time, infinite samples.
[12:29.43 - 12:29.44] Speaker: infinite sensing time, infinite samples.
[12:29.44 - 12:31.03] Speaker: infinite sensing time, infinite samples. &gt;&gt; Wow. So, it's not just about collecting
[12:31.03 - 12:31.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Wow. So, it's not just about collecting
[12:31.04 - 12:33.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Wow. So, it's not just about collecting more data. There's a point where if the
[12:33.19 - 12:33.20] Speaker: more data. There's a point where if the
[12:33.20 - 12:34.87] Speaker: more data. There's a point where if the signal is too weak relative to the
[12:34.87 - 12:34.88] Speaker: signal is too weak relative to the
[12:34.88 - 12:37.03] Speaker: signal is too weak relative to the uncertainty in the noise, detection
[12:37.03 - 12:37.04] Speaker: uncertainty in the noise, detection
[12:37.04 - 12:39.03] Speaker: uncertainty in the noise, detection becomes fundamentally impossible.
[12:39.03 - 12:39.04] Speaker: becomes fundamentally impossible.
[12:39.04 - 12:41.03] Speaker: becomes fundamentally impossible. &gt;&gt; That's exactly it. It's a hard limit
[12:41.03 - 12:41.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's exactly it. It's a hard limit
[12:41.04 - 12:43.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's exactly it. It's a hard limit imposed by the physics of the situation
[12:43.19 - 12:43.20] Speaker: imposed by the physics of the situation
[12:43.20 - 12:45.03] Speaker: imposed by the physics of the situation and the imperfection of our knowledge
[12:45.03 - 12:45.04] Speaker: and the imperfection of our knowledge
[12:45.04 - 12:47.51] Speaker: and the imperfection of our knowledge about the noise. Think of it as a
[12:47.51 - 12:47.52] Speaker: about the noise. Think of it as a
[12:47.52 - 12:49.35] Speaker: about the noise. Think of it as a fundamental sensitivity floor,
[12:49.35 - 12:49.36] Speaker: fundamental sensitivity floor,
[12:49.36 - 12:50.15] Speaker: fundamental sensitivity floor, &gt;&gt; a true wall.
[12:50.15 - 12:50.16] Speaker: &gt;&gt; a true wall.
[12:50.16 - 12:51.91] Speaker: &gt;&gt; a true wall. &gt;&gt; And here's the critical thing that shows
[12:51.91 - 12:51.92] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And here's the critical thing that shows
[12:51.92 - 12:55.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And here's the critical thing that shows just how impactful noise uncertainty is.
[12:55.19 - 12:55.20] Speaker: just how impactful noise uncertainty is.
[12:55.20 - 12:57.11] Speaker: just how impactful noise uncertainty is. If there were no noise uncertainty, if
[12:57.11 - 12:57.12] Speaker: If there were no noise uncertainty, if
[12:57.12 - 12:59.59] Speaker: If there were no noise uncertainty, if you knew the noise level perfectly, the
[12:59.59 - 12:59.60] Speaker: you knew the noise level perfectly, the
[12:59.60 - 13:01.11] Speaker: you knew the noise level perfectly, the SNR wall wouldn't exist.
[13:01.11 - 13:01.12] Speaker: SNR wall wouldn't exist.
[13:01.12 - 13:01.67] Speaker: SNR wall wouldn't exist. &gt;&gt; Really?
[13:01.67 - 13:01.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Really?
[13:01.68 - 13:04.87] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Really? &gt;&gt; Yes. Without NU, you could theoretically
[13:04.87 - 13:04.88] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes. Without NU, you could theoretically
[13:04.88 - 13:07.59] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes. Without NU, you could theoretically detect any signal, no matter how weak,
[13:07.59 - 13:07.60] Speaker: detect any signal, no matter how weak,
[13:07.60 - 13:09.83] Speaker: detect any signal, no matter how weak, as long as its SNR is above zero, just
[13:09.83 - 13:09.84] Speaker: as long as its SNR is above zero, just
[13:09.84 - 13:11.67] Speaker: as long as its SNR is above zero, just by sensing for long enough. The wall
[13:11.67 - 13:11.68] Speaker: by sensing for long enough. The wall
[13:11.68 - 13:13.19] Speaker: by sensing for long enough. The wall only appears because of the noise
[13:13.19 - 13:13.20] Speaker: only appears because of the noise
[13:13.20 - 13:13.99] Speaker: only appears because of the noise uncertainty.
[13:13.99 - 13:14.00] Speaker: uncertainty.
[13:14.00 - 13:15.91] Speaker: uncertainty. &gt;&gt; That really highlights it. NU isn't just
[13:15.91 - 13:15.92] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That really highlights it. NU isn't just
[13:15.92 - 13:17.83] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That really highlights it. NU isn't just a nuisance. It creates a fundamental
[13:17.83 - 13:17.84] Speaker: a nuisance. It creates a fundamental
[13:17.84 - 13:20.39] Speaker: a nuisance. It creates a fundamental barrier to reliable detection in low S&amp;R
[13:20.39 - 13:20.40] Speaker: barrier to reliable detection in low S&amp;R
[13:20.40 - 13:22.95] Speaker: barrier to reliable detection in low S&amp;R scenarios. Okay, so noise uncertainty is
[13:22.95 - 13:22.96] Speaker: scenarios. Okay, so noise uncertainty is
[13:22.96 - 13:25.51] Speaker: scenarios. Okay, so noise uncertainty is a major hurdle creating this SNR wall.
[13:25.51 - 13:25.52] Speaker: a major hurdle creating this SNR wall.
[13:25.52 - 13:27.51] Speaker: a major hurdle creating this SNR wall. But wireless signals face other gremlins
[13:27.51 - 13:27.52] Speaker: But wireless signals face other gremlins
[13:27.52 - 13:29.67] Speaker: But wireless signals face other gremlins too, right? We mentioned fading and
[13:29.67 - 13:29.68] Speaker: too, right? We mentioned fading and
[13:29.68 - 13:31.59] Speaker: too, right? We mentioned fading and shadowing earlier. Can we quickly recap
[13:31.59 - 13:31.60] Speaker: shadowing earlier. Can we quickly recap
[13:31.60 - 13:31.99] Speaker: shadowing earlier. Can we quickly recap those?
[13:31.99 - 13:32.00] Speaker: those?
[13:32.00 - 13:34.07] Speaker: those? &gt;&gt; Sure. Multiath fading is when the signal
[13:34.07 - 13:34.08] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Sure. Multiath fading is when the signal
[13:34.08 - 13:35.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Sure. Multiath fading is when the signal takes multiple paths to reach the
[13:35.67 - 13:35.68] Speaker: takes multiple paths to reach the
[13:35.68 - 13:37.83] Speaker: takes multiple paths to reach the receiver, bouncing off buildings, hills,
[13:37.83 - 13:37.84] Speaker: receiver, bouncing off buildings, hills,
[13:37.84 - 13:39.59] Speaker: receiver, bouncing off buildings, hills, whatever. These paths have different
[13:39.59 - 13:39.60] Speaker: whatever. These paths have different
[13:39.60 - 13:41.43] Speaker: whatever. These paths have different lengths, so the signals arrive slightly
[13:41.43 - 13:41.44] Speaker: lengths, so the signals arrive slightly
[13:41.44 - 13:42.07] Speaker: lengths, so the signals arrive slightly out of sync
[13:42.07 - 13:42.08] Speaker: out of sync
[13:42.08 - 13:43.67] Speaker: out of sync &gt;&gt; and they can interfere with each other.
[13:43.67 - 13:43.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; and they can interfere with each other.
[13:43.68 - 13:45.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; and they can interfere with each other. &gt;&gt; Right? Sometimes they add up
[13:45.67 - 13:45.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Right? Sometimes they add up
[13:45.68 - 13:47.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Right? Sometimes they add up constructively, making the signal
[13:47.43 - 13:47.44] Speaker: constructively, making the signal
[13:47.44 - 13:49.51] Speaker: constructively, making the signal strong. Other times they cancel each
[13:49.51 - 13:49.52] Speaker: strong. Other times they cancel each
[13:49.52 - 13:51.51] Speaker: strong. Other times they cancel each other out destructively causing a deep
[13:51.51 - 13:51.52] Speaker: other out destructively causing a deep
[13:51.52 - 13:54.15] Speaker: other out destructively causing a deep fade, a sudden drop in signal strength.
[13:54.15 - 13:54.16] Speaker: fade, a sudden drop in signal strength.
[13:54.16 - 13:54.79] Speaker: fade, a sudden drop in signal strength. &gt;&gt; And shadowing.
[13:54.79 - 13:54.80] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And shadowing.
[13:54.80 - 13:57.35] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And shadowing. &gt;&gt; Shadowing is more about large obstacles.
[13:57.35 - 13:57.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Shadowing is more about large obstacles.
[13:57.36 - 13:59.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Shadowing is more about large obstacles. A big building, a dense forest, a hill
[13:59.99 - 14:00.00] Speaker: A big building, a dense forest, a hill
[14:00.00 - 14:02.23] Speaker: A big building, a dense forest, a hill physically blocking the signal path. It
[14:02.23 - 14:02.24] Speaker: physically blocking the signal path. It
[14:02.24 - 14:04.71] Speaker: physically blocking the signal path. It causes slower, larger scale drops in
[14:04.71 - 14:04.72] Speaker: causes slower, larger scale drops in
[14:04.72 - 14:06.79] Speaker: causes slower, larger scale drops in signal strength over an area. Like when
[14:06.79 - 14:06.80] Speaker: signal strength over an area. Like when
[14:06.80 - 14:08.55] Speaker: signal strength over an area. Like when your cell signal disappears as you drive
[14:08.55 - 14:08.56] Speaker: your cell signal disappears as you drive
[14:08.56 - 14:09.75] Speaker: your cell signal disappears as you drive behind a big structure.
[14:09.75 - 14:09.76] Speaker: behind a big structure.
[14:09.76 - 14:11.75] Speaker: behind a big structure. &gt;&gt; And relying on just one antenna, one
[14:11.75 - 14:11.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And relying on just one antenna, one
[14:11.76 - 14:13.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And relying on just one antenna, one receiver makes you vulnerable to both of
[14:13.67 - 14:13.68] Speaker: receiver makes you vulnerable to both of
[14:13.68 - 14:14.23] Speaker: receiver makes you vulnerable to both of these.
[14:14.23 - 14:14.24] Speaker: these.
[14:14.24 - 14:16.47] Speaker: these. &gt;&gt; Extremely vulnerable. If that single
[14:16.47 - 14:16.48] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Extremely vulnerable. If that single
[14:16.48 - 14:18.31] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Extremely vulnerable. If that single antenna happens to be in a deep fade
[14:18.31 - 14:18.32] Speaker: antenna happens to be in a deep fade
[14:18.32 - 14:20.31] Speaker: antenna happens to be in a deep fade spot or behind a shadowing obstacle,
[14:20.31 - 14:20.32] Speaker: spot or behind a shadowing obstacle,
[14:20.32 - 14:22.39] Speaker: spot or behind a shadowing obstacle, your signal is gone regardless of how
[14:22.39 - 14:22.40] Speaker: your signal is gone regardless of how
[14:22.40 - 14:23.43] Speaker: your signal is gone regardless of how good your detector is.
[14:23.43 - 14:23.44] Speaker: good your detector is.
[14:23.44 - 14:25.03] Speaker: good your detector is. &gt;&gt; So, you need some way to increase
[14:25.03 - 14:25.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, you need some way to increase
[14:25.04 - 14:27.27] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, you need some way to increase resilience, teamwork, maybe.
[14:27.27 - 14:27.28] Speaker: resilience, teamwork, maybe.
[14:27.28 - 14:29.19] Speaker: resilience, teamwork, maybe. &gt;&gt; Exactly. That's where diversity schemes
[14:29.19 - 14:29.20] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. That's where diversity schemes
[14:29.20 - 14:31.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. That's where diversity schemes come in. The basic idea is to use
[14:31.43 - 14:31.44] Speaker: come in. The basic idea is to use
[14:31.44 - 14:33.35] Speaker: come in. The basic idea is to use multiple receive paths, usually multiple
[14:33.35 - 14:33.36] Speaker: multiple receive paths, usually multiple
[14:33.36 - 14:35.27] Speaker: multiple receive paths, usually multiple antennas spaced apart to get independent
[14:35.27 - 14:35.28] Speaker: antennas spaced apart to get independent
[14:35.28 - 14:36.31] Speaker: antennas spaced apart to get independent looks at the signal.
[14:36.31 - 14:36.32] Speaker: looks at the signal.
[14:36.32 - 14:38.47] Speaker: looks at the signal. &gt;&gt; So, if one antenna is in a bad spot,
[14:38.47 - 14:38.48] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, if one antenna is in a bad spot,
[14:38.48 - 14:40.15] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, if one antenna is in a bad spot, &gt;&gt; hopefully another one isn't. It's about
[14:40.15 - 14:40.16] Speaker: &gt;&gt; hopefully another one isn't. It's about
[14:40.16 - 14:41.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; hopefully another one isn't. It's about not putting all your eggs in one basket.

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

[14:41.99 - 14:42.00] Speaker: not putting all your eggs in one basket.
[14:42.00 - 14:44.07] Speaker: not putting all your eggs in one basket. It provides redundancy and makes the
[14:44.07 - 14:44.08] Speaker: It provides redundancy and makes the
[14:44.08 - 14:45.67] Speaker: It provides redundancy and makes the overall reception much more robust
[14:45.67 - 14:45.68] Speaker: overall reception much more robust
[14:45.68 - 14:47.27] Speaker: overall reception much more robust against these channel impairments.
[14:47.27 - 14:47.28] Speaker: against these channel impairments.
[14:47.28 - 14:49.35] Speaker: against these channel impairments. &gt;&gt; Makes sense. So the paper looks at
[14:49.35 - 14:49.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Makes sense. So the paper looks at
[14:49.36 - 14:52.07] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Makes sense. So the paper looks at combining these diversity ideas with the
[14:52.07 - 14:52.08] Speaker: combining these diversity ideas with the
[14:52.08 - 14:54.31] Speaker: combining these diversity ideas with the generalized energy detector. What were
[14:54.31 - 14:54.32] Speaker: generalized energy detector. What were
[14:54.32 - 14:56.07] Speaker: generalized energy detector. What were the two main schemes they investigated?
[14:56.07 - 14:56.08] Speaker: the two main schemes they investigated?
[14:56.08 - 14:58.39] Speaker: the two main schemes they investigated? &gt;&gt; They looked at two primary approaches.
[14:58.39 - 14:58.40] Speaker: &gt;&gt; They looked at two primary approaches.
[14:58.40 - 15:01.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; They looked at two primary approaches. Paw combining or PLC diversity and P law
[15:01.51 - 15:01.52] Speaker: Paw combining or PLC diversity and P law
[15:01.52 - 15:03.43] Speaker: Paw combining or PLC diversity and P law selection or PLS diversity.
[15:03.43 - 15:03.44] Speaker: selection or PLS diversity.
[15:03.44 - 15:05.75] Speaker: selection or PLS diversity. &gt;&gt; Okay. PLC first. How does combining
[15:05.75 - 15:05.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. PLC first. How does combining
[15:05.76 - 15:08.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. PLC first. How does combining work? With PLC, you take the decision
[15:08.39 - 15:08.40] Speaker: work? With PLC, you take the decision
[15:08.40 - 15:10.95] Speaker: work? With PLC, you take the decision statistic, the energy value calculated
[15:10.95 - 15:10.96] Speaker: statistic, the energy value calculated
[15:10.96 - 15:13.11] Speaker: statistic, the energy value calculated using the exponent P from each of your
[15:13.11 - 15:13.12] Speaker: using the exponent P from each of your
[15:13.12 - 15:15.51] Speaker: using the exponent P from each of your diversity branches, each antenna. Then
[15:15.51 - 15:15.52] Speaker: diversity branches, each antenna. Then
[15:15.52 - 15:17.51] Speaker: diversity branches, each antenna. Then you simply add them all together,
[15:17.51 - 15:17.52] Speaker: you simply add them all together,
[15:17.52 - 15:19.35] Speaker: you simply add them all together, &gt;&gt; summing up the energy readings from all
[15:19.35 - 15:19.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; summing up the energy readings from all
[15:19.36 - 15:20.15] Speaker: &gt;&gt; summing up the energy readings from all antennas
[15:20.15 - 15:20.16] Speaker: antennas
[15:20.16 - 15:22.55] Speaker: antennas &gt;&gt; essentially. Yes. The final decision
[15:22.55 - 15:22.56] Speaker: &gt;&gt; essentially. Yes. The final decision
[15:22.56 - 15:25.03] Speaker: &gt;&gt; essentially. Yes. The final decision signal present or absent is based on
[15:25.03 - 15:25.04] Speaker: signal present or absent is based on
[15:25.04 - 15:27.99] Speaker: signal present or absent is based on this combined sum statistic. It's like
[15:27.99 - 15:28.00] Speaker: this combined sum statistic. It's like
[15:28.00 - 15:29.59] Speaker: this combined sum statistic. It's like pooling all the information together
[15:29.59 - 15:29.60] Speaker: pooling all the information together
[15:29.60 - 15:31.51] Speaker: pooling all the information together &gt;&gt; like everyone on the team contributing
[15:31.51 - 15:31.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; like everyone on the team contributing
[15:31.52 - 15:33.35] Speaker: &gt;&gt; like everyone on the team contributing their piece of evidence and you make a
[15:33.35 - 15:33.36] Speaker: their piece of evidence and you make a
[15:33.36 - 15:34.63] Speaker: their piece of evidence and you make a decision based on the total weight of
[15:34.63 - 15:34.64] Speaker: decision based on the total weight of
[15:34.64 - 15:36.07] Speaker: decision based on the total weight of evidence. That's a good analogy. It
[15:36.07 - 15:36.08] Speaker: evidence. That's a good analogy. It
[15:36.08 - 15:37.75] Speaker: evidence. That's a good analogy. It leverages information from all paths.
[15:37.75 - 15:37.76] Speaker: leverages information from all paths.
[15:37.76 - 15:39.75] Speaker: leverages information from all paths. &gt;&gt; Okay. And the other one, PLS POW
[15:39.75 - 15:39.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. And the other one, PLS POW
[15:39.76 - 15:41.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. And the other one, PLS POW selection. How is that different?
[15:41.67 - 15:41.68] Speaker: selection. How is that different?
[15:41.68 - 15:43.59] Speaker: selection. How is that different? &gt;&gt; PLS is simpler in a way. Instead of
[15:43.59 - 15:43.60] Speaker: &gt;&gt; PLS is simpler in a way. Instead of
[15:43.60 - 15:44.79] Speaker: &gt;&gt; PLS is simpler in a way. Instead of adding everything up, you just look at
[15:44.79 - 15:44.80] Speaker: adding everything up, you just look at
[15:44.80 - 15:46.15] Speaker: adding everything up, you just look at the decision statistics from all the
[15:46.15 - 15:46.16] Speaker: the decision statistics from all the
[15:46.16 - 15:47.91] Speaker: the decision statistics from all the branches and pick the maximum one.
[15:47.91 - 15:47.92] Speaker: branches and pick the maximum one.
[15:47.92 - 15:49.35] Speaker: branches and pick the maximum one. &gt;&gt; So, you find the antenna that's getting
[15:49.35 - 15:49.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, you find the antenna that's getting
[15:49.36 - 15:50.79] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, you find the antenna that's getting the strongest signal reading at that
[15:50.79 - 15:50.80] Speaker: the strongest signal reading at that
[15:50.80 - 15:52.71] Speaker: the strongest signal reading at that moment and base your decision solely on
[15:52.71 - 15:52.72] Speaker: moment and base your decision solely on
[15:52.72 - 15:53.19] Speaker: moment and base your decision solely on that one.
[15:53.19 - 15:53.20] Speaker: that one.
[15:53.20 - 15:54.71] Speaker: that one. &gt;&gt; That's right. You just select the best
[15:54.71 - 15:54.72] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's right. You just select the best
[15:54.72 - 15:56.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's right. You just select the best performer among the branches and ignore
[15:56.55 - 15:56.56] Speaker: performer among the branches and ignore
[15:56.56 - 15:58.23] Speaker: performer among the branches and ignore the others for that decision instant.
[15:58.23 - 15:58.24] Speaker: the others for that decision instant.
[15:58.24 - 15:59.51] Speaker: the others for that decision instant. &gt;&gt; Interesting. That's like listening to
[15:59.51 - 15:59.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Interesting. That's like listening to
[15:59.52 - 16:01.27] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Interesting. That's like listening to several people talking in a noisy room
[16:01.27 - 16:01.28] Speaker: several people talking in a noisy room
[16:01.28 - 16:02.87] Speaker: several people talking in a noisy room and just focusing on the loudest,
[16:02.87 - 16:02.88] Speaker: and just focusing on the loudest,
[16:02.88 - 16:06.39] Speaker: and just focusing on the loudest, clearest voice. Exactly. So both PLC and
[16:06.39 - 16:06.40] Speaker: clearest voice. Exactly. So both PLC and
[16:06.40 - 16:08.71] Speaker: clearest voice. Exactly. So both PLC and PLS use multiple antennas to improve
[16:08.71 - 16:08.72] Speaker: PLS use multiple antennas to improve
[16:08.72 - 16:10.23] Speaker: PLS use multiple antennas to improve performance, but they do it very
[16:10.23 - 16:10.24] Speaker: performance, but they do it very
[16:10.24 - 16:14.15] Speaker: performance, but they do it very differently. PLC aggregates PLS selects
[16:14.15 - 16:14.16] Speaker: differently. PLC aggregates PLS selects
[16:14.16 - 16:16.47] Speaker: differently. PLC aggregates PLS selects the best. Understanding which one works
[16:16.47 - 16:16.48] Speaker: the best. Understanding which one works
[16:16.48 - 16:18.39] Speaker: the best. Understanding which one works better under which conditions is a key
[16:18.39 - 16:18.40] Speaker: better under which conditions is a key
[16:18.40 - 16:20.47] Speaker: better under which conditions is a key part of the paper's investigation.
[16:20.47 - 16:20.48] Speaker: part of the paper's investigation.
[16:20.48 - 16:22.71] Speaker: part of the paper's investigation. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's get into those findings now.
[16:22.71 - 16:22.72] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, let's get into those findings now.
[16:22.72 - 16:25.35] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, let's get into those findings now. The paper really dissected the SNR wall,
[16:25.35 - 16:25.36] Speaker: The paper really dissected the SNR wall,
[16:25.36 - 16:27.91] Speaker: The paper really dissected the SNR wall, starting with that simpler AWGN channel
[16:27.91 - 16:27.92] Speaker: starting with that simpler AWGN channel
[16:27.92 - 16:30.07] Speaker: starting with that simpler AWGN channel model, but importantly still including
[16:30.07 - 16:30.08] Speaker: model, but importantly still including
[16:30.08 - 16:32.23] Speaker: model, but importantly still including noise uncertainty. What did they find
[16:32.23 - 16:32.24] Speaker: noise uncertainty. What did they find
[16:32.24 - 16:34.79] Speaker: noise uncertainty. What did they find for a single receiver? No diversity,
[16:34.79 - 16:34.80] Speaker: for a single receiver? No diversity,
[16:34.80 - 16:37.67] Speaker: for a single receiver? No diversity, &gt;&gt; right? So just one antenna, AWGN noise,
[16:37.67 - 16:37.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right? So just one antenna, AWGN noise,
[16:37.68 - 16:39.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right? So just one antenna, AWGN noise, but with that pesky noise uncertainty
[16:39.99 - 16:40.00] Speaker: but with that pesky noise uncertainty
[16:40.00 - 16:40.79] Speaker: but with that pesky noise uncertainty and you
[16:40.79 - 16:40.80] Speaker: and you
[16:40.80 - 16:42.63] Speaker: and you &gt;&gt; they derived a mathematical formula for
[16:42.63 - 16:42.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; they derived a mathematical formula for
[16:42.64 - 16:45.83] Speaker: &gt;&gt; they derived a mathematical formula for the SNR wall. And the key finding was uh
[16:45.83 - 16:45.84] Speaker: the SNR wall. And the key finding was uh
[16:45.84 - 16:47.19] Speaker: the SNR wall. And the key finding was uh perhaps a bit surprising,
[16:47.19 - 16:47.20] Speaker: perhaps a bit surprising,
[16:47.20 - 16:47.75] Speaker: perhaps a bit surprising, &gt;&gt; which was
[16:47.75 - 16:47.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which was
[16:47.76 - 16:49.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which was &gt;&gt; the SNR wall in this single receiver
[16:49.51 - 16:49.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; the SNR wall in this single receiver
[16:49.52 - 16:51.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; the SNR wall in this single receiver case is completely independent of the P
[16:51.67 - 16:51.68] Speaker: case is completely independent of the P
[16:51.68 - 16:53.19] Speaker: case is completely independent of the P value in the generalized energy
[16:53.19 - 16:53.20] Speaker: value in the generalized energy
[16:53.20 - 16:53.91] Speaker: value in the generalized energy detector.
[16:53.91 - 16:53.92] Speaker: detector.
[16:53.92 - 16:56.07] Speaker: detector. &gt;&gt; Wow. So fiddling with P doesn't help you
[16:56.07 - 16:56.08] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Wow. So fiddling with P doesn't help you
[16:56.08 - 16:58.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Wow. So fiddling with P doesn't help you overcome the wall if you only have one
[16:58.39 - 16:58.40] Speaker: overcome the wall if you only have one
[16:58.40 - 17:00.79] Speaker: overcome the wall if you only have one antenna. Whether you use P2 or P3 or
[17:00.79 - 17:00.80] Speaker: antenna. Whether you use P2 or P3 or
[17:00.80 - 17:02.55] Speaker: antenna. Whether you use P2 or P3 or whatever, the fundamental limit set by
[17:02.55 - 17:02.56] Speaker: whatever, the fundamental limit set by
[17:02.56 - 17:04.07] Speaker: whatever, the fundamental limit set by NU stays the same.
[17:04.07 - 17:04.08] Speaker: NU stays the same.
[17:04.08 - 17:07.59] Speaker: NU stays the same. &gt;&gt; Exactly. The formula they derived 10 L
[17:07.59 - 17:07.60] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. The formula they derived 10 L
[17:07.60 - 17:09.59] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. The formula they derived 10 L 10 hounds where L is the noise
[17:09.59 - 17:09.60] Speaker: 10 hounds where L is the noise
[17:09.60 - 17:12.39] Speaker: 10 hounds where L is the noise uncertainty in DB shows the wall depends
[17:12.39 - 17:12.40] Speaker: uncertainty in DB shows the wall depends
[17:12.40 - 17:15.03] Speaker: uncertainty in DB shows the wall depends only on L the level of uncertainty not
[17:15.03 - 17:15.04] Speaker: only on L the level of uncertainty not
[17:15.04 - 17:18.87] Speaker: only on L the level of uncertainty not on P. If L is zero, no uncertainty, the
[17:18.87 - 17:18.88] Speaker: on P. If L is zero, no uncertainty, the
[17:18.88 - 17:21.27] Speaker: on P. If L is zero, no uncertainty, the wall is zero SNR, meaning perfect
[17:21.27 - 17:21.28] Speaker: wall is zero SNR, meaning perfect
[17:21.28 - 17:23.27] Speaker: wall is zero SNR, meaning perfect detection is possible. But any
[17:23.27 - 17:23.28] Speaker: detection is possible. But any
[17:23.28 - 17:25.75] Speaker: detection is possible. But any uncertainty L0 creates a wall and P
[17:25.75 - 17:25.76] Speaker: uncertainty L0 creates a wall and P
[17:25.76 - 17:27.03] Speaker: uncertainty L0 creates a wall and P can't tear it down.
[17:27.03 - 17:27.04] Speaker: can't tear it down.
[17:27.04 - 17:29.03] Speaker: can't tear it down. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's clear. But what happens
[17:29.03 - 17:29.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, that's clear. But what happens
[17:29.04 - 17:30.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, that's clear. But what happens when you bring in diversity? Let's start
[17:30.55 - 17:30.56] Speaker: when you bring in diversity? Let's start
[17:30.56 - 17:32.95] Speaker: when you bring in diversity? Let's start with PLC, the combining scheme. Does
[17:32.95 - 17:32.96] Speaker: with PLC, the combining scheme. Does
[17:32.96 - 17:33.83] Speaker: with PLC, the combining scheme. Does that change things?
[17:33.83 - 17:33.84] Speaker: that change things?
[17:33.84 - 17:35.27] Speaker: that change things? &gt;&gt; It does, but it depends. The analysis
[17:35.27 - 17:35.28] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It does, but it depends. The analysis
[17:35.28 - 17:36.87] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It does, but it depends. The analysis gets more complex, especially if the
[17:36.87 - 17:36.88] Speaker: gets more complex, especially if the
[17:36.88 - 17:39.75] Speaker: gets more complex, especially if the noise uncertainty L or the average SNR
[17:39.75 - 17:39.76] Speaker: noise uncertainty L or the average SNR
[17:39.76 - 17:41.51] Speaker: noise uncertainty L or the average SNR is different at each antenna, which is
[17:41.51 - 17:41.52] Speaker: is different at each antenna, which is
[17:41.52 - 17:42.39] Speaker: is different at each antenna, which is realistic.
[17:42.39 - 17:42.40] Speaker: realistic.
[17:42.40 - 17:44.23] Speaker: realistic. &gt;&gt; So, what did they find in those cases?
[17:44.23 - 17:44.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, what did they find in those cases?
[17:44.24 - 17:46.23] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, what did they find in those cases? &gt;&gt; Two main things. First, if you have a
[17:46.23 - 17:46.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Two main things. First, if you have a
[17:46.24 - 17:48.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Two main things. First, if you have a homogeneous setup, meaning all antennas
[17:48.39 - 17:48.40] Speaker: homogeneous setup, meaning all antennas
[17:48.40 - 17:50.31] Speaker: homogeneous setup, meaning all antennas experience the same noise uncertainty,
[17:50.31 - 17:50.32] Speaker: experience the same noise uncertainty,
[17:50.32 - 17:53.35] Speaker: experience the same noise uncertainty, L1 L2L, and the same average SNR, then
[17:53.35 - 17:53.36] Speaker: L1 L2L, and the same average SNR, then
[17:53.36 - 17:55.27] Speaker: L1 L2L, and the same average SNR, then the SNR wall is still the same as the no
[17:55.27 - 17:55.28] Speaker: the SNR wall is still the same as the no
[17:55.28 - 17:56.55] Speaker: the SNR wall is still the same as the no diversity case, and it's still
[17:56.55 - 17:56.56] Speaker: diversity case, and it's still
[17:56.56 - 17:58.95] Speaker: diversity case, and it's still independent of P. So just combining
[17:58.95 - 17:58.96] Speaker: independent of P. So just combining
[17:58.96 - 18:01.19] Speaker: independent of P. So just combining identical inputs doesn't magically make
[18:01.19 - 18:01.20] Speaker: identical inputs doesn't magically make
[18:01.20 - 18:03.03] Speaker: identical inputs doesn't magically make EP matter for the wall itself.
[18:03.03 - 18:03.04] Speaker: EP matter for the wall itself.
[18:03.04 - 18:05.11] Speaker: EP matter for the wall itself. &gt;&gt; Not for the wall location. No, the
[18:05.11 - 18:05.12] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Not for the wall location. No, the
[18:05.12 - 18:07.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Not for the wall location. No, the combining still helps fight fading, but
[18:07.51 - 18:07.52] Speaker: combining still helps fight fading, but
[18:07.52 - 18:09.27] Speaker: combining still helps fight fading, but doesn't change the fundamental pain
[18:09.27 - 18:09.28] Speaker: doesn't change the fundamental pain
[18:09.28 - 18:11.75] Speaker: doesn't change the fundamental pain independence of the NU induced wall in
[18:11.75 - 18:11.76] Speaker: independence of the NU induced wall in
[18:11.76 - 18:13.03] Speaker: independence of the NU induced wall in this specific scenario.
[18:13.03 - 18:13.04] Speaker: this specific scenario.
[18:13.04 - 18:14.71] Speaker: this specific scenario. &gt;&gt; But what about the more realistic
[18:14.71 - 18:14.72] Speaker: &gt;&gt; But what about the more realistic
[18:14.72 - 18:17.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; But what about the more realistic heterogeneous case where the SNRs are
[18:17.19 - 18:17.20] Speaker: heterogeneous case where the SNRs are
[18:17.20 - 18:18.55] Speaker: heterogeneous case where the SNRs are different at each antenna?
[18:18.55 - 18:18.56] Speaker: different at each antenna?
[18:18.56 - 18:21.03] Speaker: different at each antenna? &gt;&gt; Uh, now it gets interesting. This is a

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

[18:21.03 - 18:21.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Uh, now it gets interesting. This is a
[18:21.04 - 18:23.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Uh, now it gets interesting. This is a huge finding. When the SNRs differ
[18:23.51 - 18:23.52] Speaker: huge finding. When the SNRs differ
[18:23.52 - 18:26.07] Speaker: huge finding. When the SNRs differ across branches, the SNR wall does
[18:26.07 - 18:26.08] Speaker: across branches, the SNR wall does
[18:26.08 - 18:28.31] Speaker: across branches, the SNR wall does become dependent on the value of P.
[18:28.31 - 18:28.32] Speaker: become dependent on the value of P.
[18:28.32 - 18:30.47] Speaker: become dependent on the value of P. &gt;&gt; Really? So P suddenly matters.
[18:30.47 - 18:30.48] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Really? So P suddenly matters.
[18:30.48 - 18:33.11] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Really? So P suddenly matters. &gt;&gt; Yes. And crucially, they found that
[18:33.11 - 18:33.12] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes. And crucially, they found that
[18:33.12 - 18:35.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes. And crucially, they found that increasing the value of P when using PLC
[18:35.43 - 18:35.44] Speaker: increasing the value of P when using PLC
[18:35.44 - 18:37.91] Speaker: increasing the value of P when using PLC diversity with unequal SNRs can actually
[18:37.91 - 18:37.92] Speaker: diversity with unequal SNRs can actually
[18:37.92 - 18:39.27] Speaker: diversity with unequal SNRs can actually lower the SNR wall.
[18:39.27 - 18:39.28] Speaker: lower the SNR wall.
[18:39.28 - 18:40.63] Speaker: lower the SNR wall. &gt;&gt; Lowering the wall means better
[18:40.63 - 18:40.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Lowering the wall means better
[18:40.64 - 18:41.91] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Lowering the wall means better performance, right? You can detect
[18:41.91 - 18:41.92] Speaker: performance, right? You can detect
[18:41.92 - 18:43.51] Speaker: performance, right? You can detect weaker signals reliably.
[18:43.51 - 18:43.52] Speaker: weaker signals reliably.
[18:43.52 - 18:46.15] Speaker: weaker signals reliably. &gt;&gt; Exactly. A lower wall is always better.
[18:46.15 - 18:46.16] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. A lower wall is always better.
[18:46.16 - 18:48.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. A lower wall is always better. It means you need less signal strength
[18:48.55 - 18:48.56] Speaker: It means you need less signal strength
[18:48.56 - 18:50.87] Speaker: It means you need less signal strength to achieve that unlimited reliability.
[18:50.87 - 18:50.88] Speaker: to achieve that unlimited reliability.
[18:50.88 - 18:52.23] Speaker: to achieve that unlimited reliability. Can you give an example? How much
[18:52.23 - 18:52.24] Speaker: Can you give an example? How much
[18:52.24 - 18:53.51] Speaker: Can you give an example? How much difference can P make here?
[18:53.51 - 18:53.52] Speaker: difference can P make here?
[18:53.52 - 18:55.83] Speaker: difference can P make here? &gt;&gt; The paper gives a numerical example. Two
[18:55.83 - 18:55.84] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The paper gives a numerical example. Two
[18:55.84 - 18:58.63] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The paper gives a numerical example. Two branches both with L1 dB noise
[18:58.63 - 18:58.64] Speaker: branches both with L1 dB noise
[18:58.64 - 19:00.87] Speaker: branches both with L1 dB noise uncertainty. Let's say branch 2 has a
[19:00.87 - 19:00.88] Speaker: uncertainty. Let's say branch 2 has a
[19:00.88 - 19:03.43] Speaker: uncertainty. Let's say branch 2 has a low SNR bellow.1.
[19:03.43 - 19:03.44] Speaker: low SNR bellow.1.
[19:03.44 - 19:05.35] Speaker: low SNR bellow.1. To achieve unlimited reliability, the
[19:05.35 - 19:05.36] Speaker: To achieve unlimited reliability, the
[19:05.36 - 19:07.67] Speaker: To achieve unlimited reliability, the required SNR on branch one, which is the
[19:07.67 - 19:07.68] Speaker: required SNR on branch one, which is the
[19:07.68 - 19:10.15] Speaker: required SNR on branch one, which is the wall in this context, decreased as P
[19:10.15 - 19:10.16] Speaker: wall in this context, decreased as P
[19:10.16 - 19:12.15] Speaker: wall in this context, decreased as P increased. For P1, you needed gull
[19:12.15 - 19:12.16] Speaker: increased. For P1, you needed gull
[19:12.16 - 19:15.35] Speaker: increased. For P1, you needed gull 1.8914, but for PP5, you only needed
[19:15.35 - 19:15.36] Speaker: 1.8914, but for PP5, you only needed
[19:15.36 - 19:17.83] Speaker: 1.8914, but for PP5, you only needed gull 1.7153.
[19:17.83 - 19:17.84] Speaker: gull 1.7153.
[19:17.84 - 19:19.83] Speaker: gull 1.7153. &gt;&gt; That's a reduction of almost 1 dB.
[19:19.83 - 19:19.84] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a reduction of almost 1 dB.
[19:19.84 - 19:21.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a reduction of almost 1 dB. That's significant in wireless terms.
[19:21.99 - 19:22.00] Speaker: That's significant in wireless terms.
[19:22.00 - 19:24.71] Speaker: That's significant in wireless terms. &gt;&gt; It really is. It shows that with PLC, if
[19:24.71 - 19:24.72] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It really is. It shows that with PLC, if
[19:24.72 - 19:26.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It really is. It shows that with PLC, if you have at least one branch with a
[19:26.39 - 19:26.40] Speaker: you have at least one branch with a
[19:26.40 - 19:28.79] Speaker: you have at least one branch with a decent signal, even if others are weak,
[19:28.79 - 19:28.80] Speaker: decent signal, even if others are weak,
[19:28.80 - 19:31.11] Speaker: decent signal, even if others are weak, optimizing P helps you leverage that
[19:31.11 - 19:31.12] Speaker: optimizing P helps you leverage that
[19:31.12 - 19:32.95] Speaker: optimizing P helps you leverage that good branch more effectively to overcome
[19:32.95 - 19:32.96] Speaker: good branch more effectively to overcome
[19:32.96 - 19:33.51] Speaker: good branch more effectively to overcome the wall.
[19:33.51 - 19:33.52] Speaker: the wall.
[19:33.52 - 19:35.51] Speaker: the wall. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's powerful for PLC. What
[19:35.51 - 19:35.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, that's powerful for PLC. What
[19:35.52 - 19:37.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, that's powerful for PLC. What about PLS? The selection diversity where
[19:37.51 - 19:37.52] Speaker: about PLS? The selection diversity where
[19:37.52 - 19:39.03] Speaker: about PLS? The selection diversity where you just pick the best signal. How does
[19:39.03 - 19:39.04] Speaker: you just pick the best signal. How does
[19:39.04 - 19:40.23] Speaker: you just pick the best signal. How does the wall behave there?
[19:40.23 - 19:40.24] Speaker: the wall behave there?
[19:40.24 - 19:42.15] Speaker: the wall behave there? &gt;&gt; For PLS, the finding was simpler. The
[19:42.15 - 19:42.16] Speaker: &gt;&gt; For PLS, the finding was simpler. The
[19:42.16 - 19:44.31] Speaker: &gt;&gt; For PLS, the finding was simpler. The SNR wall is independent of P, just like
[19:44.31 - 19:44.32] Speaker: SNR wall is independent of P, just like
[19:44.32 - 19:45.43] Speaker: SNR wall is independent of P, just like the no diversity case.
[19:45.43 - 19:45.44] Speaker: the no diversity case.
[19:45.44 - 19:47.11] Speaker: the no diversity case. &gt;&gt; So, no benefit from tuning P with
[19:47.11 - 19:47.12] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, no benefit from tuning P with
[19:47.12 - 19:48.63] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, no benefit from tuning P with selection diversity when it comes to the
[19:48.63 - 19:48.64] Speaker: selection diversity when it comes to the
[19:48.64 - 19:50.79] Speaker: selection diversity when it comes to the wall. Correct. But PLS has a different
[19:50.79 - 19:50.80] Speaker: wall. Correct. But PLS has a different
[19:50.80 - 19:52.63] Speaker: wall. Correct. But PLS has a different kind of advantage. For unlimited
[19:52.63 - 19:52.64] Speaker: kind of advantage. For unlimited
[19:52.64 - 19:54.87] Speaker: kind of advantage. For unlimited reliability with PLS, you only need the
[19:54.87 - 19:54.88] Speaker: reliability with PLS, you only need the
[19:54.88 - 19:57.43] Speaker: reliability with PLS, you only need the SNR at any single branch to be above its
[19:57.43 - 19:57.44] Speaker: SNR at any single branch to be above its
[19:57.44 - 19:58.55] Speaker: SNR at any single branch to be above its own SNR wall.
[19:58.55 - 19:58.56] Speaker: own SNR wall.
[19:58.56 - 20:01.59] Speaker: own SNR wall. &gt;&gt; Ah, it's an or condition, not an add. So
[20:01.59 - 20:01.60] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Ah, it's an or condition, not an add. So
[20:01.60 - 20:04.87] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Ah, it's an or condition, not an add. So if antenna 1 has SNR above its wall or
[20:04.87 - 20:04.88] Speaker: if antenna 1 has SNR above its wall or
[20:04.88 - 20:07.67] Speaker: if antenna 1 has SNR above its wall or antenna 2 has SNR above its wall, you're
[20:07.67 - 20:07.68] Speaker: antenna 2 has SNR above its wall, you're
[20:07.68 - 20:08.23] Speaker: antenna 2 has SNR above its wall, you're good.
[20:08.23 - 20:08.24] Speaker: good.
[20:08.24 - 20:11.51] Speaker: good. &gt;&gt; Exactly. Using their example, if L1.5 dB
[20:11.51 - 20:11.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. Using their example, if L1.5 dB
[20:11.52 - 20:14.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. Using their example, if L1.5 dB wall, wall 23, and L2.319,
[20:14.39 - 20:14.40] Speaker: wall, wall 23, and L2.319,
[20:14.40 - 20:18.23] Speaker: wall, wall 23, and L2.319, you just need either over 23 or 0.23 23
[20:18.23 - 20:18.24] Speaker: you just need either over 23 or 0.23 23
[20:18.24 - 20:20.15] Speaker: you just need either over 23 or 0.23 23 or well 4.19.
[20:20.15 - 20:20.16] Speaker: or well 4.19.
[20:20.16 - 20:22.23] Speaker: or well 4.19. &gt;&gt; That sounds incredibly resilient.
[20:22.23 - 20:22.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That sounds incredibly resilient.
[20:22.24 - 20:24.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That sounds incredibly resilient. &gt;&gt; One good antenna path can basically save
[20:24.39 - 20:24.40] Speaker: &gt;&gt; One good antenna path can basically save
[20:24.40 - 20:26.71] Speaker: &gt;&gt; One good antenna path can basically save the day even if the others are terrible.
[20:26.71 - 20:26.72] Speaker: the day even if the others are terrible.
[20:26.72 - 20:28.55] Speaker: the day even if the others are terrible. &gt;&gt; That's the key benefit of PLS. It's
[20:28.55 - 20:28.56] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's the key benefit of PLS. It's
[20:28.56 - 20:30.31] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's the key benefit of PLS. It's robust because it only relies on the
[20:30.31 - 20:30.32] Speaker: robust because it only relies on the
[20:30.32 - 20:32.31] Speaker: robust because it only relies on the best instantaneous condition available
[20:32.31 - 20:32.32] Speaker: best instantaneous condition available
[20:32.32 - 20:33.43] Speaker: best instantaneous condition available across all branches.
[20:33.43 - 20:33.44] Speaker: across all branches.
[20:33.44 - 20:35.91] Speaker: across all branches. &gt;&gt; Okay, that covers the AWGN case. Now,
[20:35.91 - 20:35.92] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, that covers the AWGN case. Now,
[20:35.92 - 20:37.75] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay, that covers the AWGN case. Now, let's make it even more real by adding
[20:37.75 - 20:37.76] Speaker: let's make it even more real by adding
[20:37.76 - 20:39.83] Speaker: let's make it even more real by adding fading. They use the Nakagami fading
[20:39.83 - 20:39.84] Speaker: fading. They use the Nakagami fading
[20:39.84 - 20:40.63] Speaker: fading. They use the Nakagami fading model, right?
[20:40.63 - 20:40.64] Speaker: model, right?
[20:40.64 - 20:42.39] Speaker: model, right? &gt;&gt; Yes. Nakagami fading, which is quite
[20:42.39 - 20:42.40] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes. Nakagami fading, which is quite
[20:42.40 - 20:43.83] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes. Nakagami fading, which is quite general and can represent various
[20:43.83 - 20:43.84] Speaker: general and can represent various
[20:43.84 - 20:45.75] Speaker: general and can represent various environments from mild to severe fading.
[20:45.75 - 20:45.76] Speaker: environments from mild to severe fading.
[20:45.76 - 20:47.67] Speaker: environments from mild to severe fading. So you got noise uncertainty A and D
[20:47.67 - 20:47.68] Speaker: So you got noise uncertainty A and D
[20:47.68 - 20:49.59] Speaker: So you got noise uncertainty A and D fading. Now what does that do to the SNR
[20:49.59 - 20:49.60] Speaker: fading. Now what does that do to the SNR
[20:49.60 - 20:50.23] Speaker: fading. Now what does that do to the SNR wall?
[20:50.23 - 20:50.24] Speaker: wall?
[20:50.24 - 20:52.23] Speaker: wall? &gt;&gt; It makes it significantly worse. The
[20:52.23 - 20:52.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It makes it significantly worse. The
[20:52.24 - 20:53.75] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It makes it significantly worse. The paper shows that when you consider both
[20:53.75 - 20:53.76] Speaker: paper shows that when you consider both
[20:53.76 - 20:56.55] Speaker: paper shows that when you consider both NU and fading, the SNR wall increases
[20:56.55 - 20:56.56] Speaker: NU and fading, the SNR wall increases
[20:56.56 - 20:58.47] Speaker: NU and fading, the SNR wall increases substantially compared to the NU only
[20:58.47 - 20:58.48] Speaker: substantially compared to the NU only
[20:58.48 - 20:58.95] Speaker: substantially compared to the NU only case.
[20:58.95 - 20:58.96] Speaker: case.
[20:58.96 - 21:00.87] Speaker: case. &gt;&gt; Meaning you need a much stronger signal
[21:00.87 - 21:00.88] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Meaning you need a much stronger signal
[21:00.88 - 21:02.79] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Meaning you need a much stronger signal to achieve reliable detection.
[21:02.79 - 21:02.80] Speaker: to achieve reliable detection.
[21:02.80 - 21:05.27] Speaker: to achieve reliable detection. &gt;&gt; Much stronger. Fading adds another layer
[21:05.27 - 21:05.28] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Much stronger. Fading adds another layer
[21:05.28 - 21:07.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Much stronger. Fading adds another layer of difficulty on top of the uncertainty.
[21:07.51 - 21:07.52] Speaker: of difficulty on top of the uncertainty.
[21:07.52 - 21:09.27] Speaker: of difficulty on top of the uncertainty. And interestingly, they noted that for
[21:09.27 - 21:09.28] Speaker: And interestingly, they noted that for
[21:09.28 - 21:11.11] Speaker: And interestingly, they noted that for fading channels, they couldn't find a
[21:11.11 - 21:11.12] Speaker: fading channels, they couldn't find a
[21:11.12 - 21:13.35] Speaker: fading channels, they couldn't find a neat mathematical formula for the wall.
[21:13.35 - 21:13.36] Speaker: neat mathematical formula for the wall.
[21:13.36 - 21:14.87] Speaker: neat mathematical formula for the wall. They had to rely on numerical
[21:14.87 - 21:14.88] Speaker: They had to rely on numerical
[21:14.88 - 21:16.95] Speaker: They had to rely on numerical simulations to find its value.
[21:16.95 - 21:16.96] Speaker: simulations to find its value.
[21:16.96 - 21:18.31] Speaker: simulations to find its value. &gt;&gt; Can you give us a number to illustrate
[21:18.31 - 21:18.32] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Can you give us a number to illustrate
[21:18.32 - 21:19.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Can you give us a number to illustrate how much worse it gets?
[21:19.51 - 21:19.52] Speaker: how much worse it gets?
[21:19.52 - 21:23.03] Speaker: how much worse it gets? &gt;&gt; Sure. For P2, L0.5DB
[21:23.03 - 21:23.04] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Sure. For P2, L0.5DB
[21:23.04 - 21:25.03] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Sure. For P2, L0.5DB noise uncertainty and a moderate
[21:25.03 - 21:25.04] Speaker: noise uncertainty and a moderate
[21:25.04 - 21:28.39] Speaker: noise uncertainty and a moderate Nakagami fading parameter M2. The SNR
[21:28.39 - 21:28.40] Speaker: Nakagami fading parameter M2. The SNR
[21:28.40 - 21:31.51] Speaker: Nakagami fading parameter M2. The SNR wall without diversity jumped from 2308
[21:31.51 - 21:31.52] Speaker: wall without diversity jumped from 2308
[21:31.52 - 21:35.67] Speaker: wall without diversity jumped from 2308 AWGN with NU to 1.841 fading with NU.
[21:35.67 - 21:35.68] Speaker: AWGN with NU to 1.841 fading with NU.
[21:35.68 - 21:37.91] Speaker: AWGN with NU to 1.841 fading with NU. &gt;&gt; Whoa, that's a huge jump. Almost eight
[21:37.91 - 21:37.92] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Whoa, that's a huge jump. Almost eight
[21:37.92 - 21:39.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Whoa, that's a huge jump. Almost eight times higher in linear terms or over 8
[21:39.99 - 21:40.00] Speaker: times higher in linear terms or over 8
[21:40.00 - 21:40.63] Speaker: times higher in linear terms or over 8 dB.
[21:40.63 - 21:40.64] Speaker: dB.
[21:40.64 - 21:42.47] Speaker: dB. &gt;&gt; It's a very significant increase. Yes,
[21:42.47 - 21:42.48] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's a very significant increase. Yes,
[21:42.48 - 21:44.47] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It's a very significant increase. Yes, around 9 dB actually. It highlights how
[21:44.47 - 21:44.48] Speaker: around 9 dB actually. It highlights how
[21:44.48 - 21:46.23] Speaker: around 9 dB actually. It highlights how much harder fading makes the detection
[21:46.23 - 21:46.24] Speaker: much harder fading makes the detection
[21:46.24 - 21:47.59] Speaker: much harder fading makes the detection problem, especially when coupled with
[21:47.59 - 21:47.60] Speaker: problem, especially when coupled with
[21:47.60 - 21:48.47] Speaker: problem, especially when coupled with noise uncertainty.
[21:48.47 - 21:48.48] Speaker: noise uncertainty.
[21:48.48 - 21:50.47] Speaker: noise uncertainty. &gt;&gt; But diversity still helps even in these
[21:50.47 - 21:50.48] Speaker: &gt;&gt; But diversity still helps even in these
[21:50.48 - 21:52.07] Speaker: &gt;&gt; But diversity still helps even in these really tough fading conditions.
[21:52.07 - 21:52.08] Speaker: really tough fading conditions.
[21:52.08 - 21:53.59] Speaker: really tough fading conditions. &gt;&gt; Oh, definitely. It's even more crucial
[21:53.59 - 21:53.60] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Oh, definitely. It's even more crucial
[21:53.60 - 21:55.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Oh, definitely. It's even more crucial here. For example, using PLC diversity
[21:55.51 - 21:55.52] Speaker: here. For example, using PLC diversity
[21:55.52 - 21:58.47] Speaker: here. For example, using PLC diversity with P2 LL0.5 dB M plus2 on both
[21:58.47 - 21:58.48] Speaker: with P2 LL0.5 dB M plus2 on both
[21:58.48 - 22:01.75] Speaker: with P2 LL0.5 dB M plus2 on both branches. The SNR wall came down to 0.67

FULL TRANSCRIPT:

[22:01.75 - 22:01.76] Speaker: branches. The SNR wall came down to 0.67
[22:01.76 - 22:02.71] Speaker: branches. The SNR wall came down to 0.67 for each branch.
[22:02.71 - 22:02.72] Speaker: for each branch.
[22:02.72 - 22:05.35] Speaker: for each branch. &gt;&gt; Okay. 67 is still higher than the EWGN
[22:05.35 - 22:05.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. 67 is still higher than the EWGN
[22:05.36 - 22:07.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. 67 is still higher than the EWGN case, but much much better than the
[22:07.19 - 22:07.20] Speaker: case, but much much better than the
[22:07.20 - 22:09.75] Speaker: case, but much much better than the 1.841 without diversity invading.
[22:09.75 - 22:09.76] Speaker: 1.841 without diversity invading.
[22:09.76 - 22:12.07] Speaker: 1.841 without diversity invading. &gt;&gt; Exactly. It shows diversity provides
[22:12.07 - 22:12.08] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. It shows diversity provides
[22:12.08 - 22:14.23] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. It shows diversity provides substantial gains pushing that wall down
[22:14.23 - 22:14.24] Speaker: substantial gains pushing that wall down
[22:14.24 - 22:16.79] Speaker: substantial gains pushing that wall down considerably even when facing both NU
[22:16.79 - 22:16.80] Speaker: considerably even when facing both NU
[22:16.80 - 22:20.23] Speaker: considerably even when facing both NU and fading. And for PLS and fading, the
[22:20.23 - 22:20.24] Speaker: and fading. And for PLS and fading, the
[22:20.24 - 22:22.39] Speaker: and fading. And for PLS and fading, the wall remained independent of P just like
[22:22.39 - 22:22.40] Speaker: wall remained independent of P just like
[22:22.40 - 22:23.19] Speaker: wall remained independent of P just like before.
[22:23.19 - 22:23.20] Speaker: before.
[22:23.20 - 22:24.87] Speaker: before. &gt;&gt; This is incredibly insightful about the
[22:24.87 - 22:24.88] Speaker: &gt;&gt; This is incredibly insightful about the
[22:24.88 - 22:26.87] Speaker: &gt;&gt; This is incredibly insightful about the fundamental limits. But the paper went
[22:26.87 - 22:26.88] Speaker: fundamental limits. But the paper went
[22:26.88 - 22:28.63] Speaker: fundamental limits. But the paper went beyond just the wall, right? It looked
[22:28.63 - 22:28.64] Speaker: beyond just the wall, right? It looked
[22:28.64 - 22:30.07] Speaker: beyond just the wall, right? It looked at overall performance and offered
[22:30.07 - 22:30.08] Speaker: at overall performance and offered
[22:30.08 - 22:32.23] Speaker: at overall performance and offered practical takeaways. What about the
[22:32.23 - 22:32.24] Speaker: practical takeaways. What about the
[22:32.24 - 22:34.87] Speaker: practical takeaways. What about the optimal P value for the GED in general
[22:34.87 - 22:34.88] Speaker: optimal P value for the GED in general
[22:34.88 - 22:35.43] Speaker: optimal P value for the GED in general use?
[22:35.43 - 22:35.44] Speaker: use?
[22:35.44 - 22:36.95] Speaker: use? &gt;&gt; Yes, they looked at detection
[22:36.95 - 22:36.96] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes, they looked at detection
[22:36.96 - 22:39.27] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes, they looked at detection probability, not just the wall. And this
[22:39.27 - 22:39.28] Speaker: probability, not just the wall. And this
[22:39.28 - 22:41.67] Speaker: probability, not just the wall. And this is a key practical finding for
[22:41.67 - 22:41.68] Speaker: is a key practical finding for
[22:41.68 - 22:44.31] Speaker: is a key practical finding for sufficiently high sample sizes N meaning
[22:44.31 - 22:44.32] Speaker: sufficiently high sample sizes N meaning
[22:44.32 - 22:46.15] Speaker: sufficiently high sample sizes N meaning you have a decent amount of sensing time
[22:46.15 - 22:46.16] Speaker: you have a decent amount of sensing time
[22:46.16 - 22:46.87] Speaker: you have a decent amount of sensing time or data
[22:46.87 - 22:46.88] Speaker: or data
[22:46.88 - 22:48.23] Speaker: or data &gt;&gt; which you'd want in a real system
[22:48.23 - 22:48.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which you'd want in a real system
[22:48.24 - 22:50.63] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which you'd want in a real system &gt;&gt; right in that case the GED performs best
[22:50.63 - 22:50.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right in that case the GED performs best
[22:50.64 - 22:53.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; right in that case the GED performs best when P is close to two. So back to the
[22:53.51 - 22:53.52] Speaker: when P is close to two. So back to the
[22:53.52 - 22:54.87] Speaker: when P is close to two. So back to the standard energy detector
[22:54.87 - 22:54.88] Speaker: standard energy detector
[22:54.88 - 22:56.95] Speaker: standard energy detector &gt;&gt; pretty much it suggests that while other
[22:56.95 - 22:56.96] Speaker: &gt;&gt; pretty much it suggests that while other
[22:56.96 - 22:59.03] Speaker: &gt;&gt; pretty much it suggests that while other P values might offer theoretical
[22:59.03 - 22:59.04] Speaker: P values might offer theoretical
[22:59.04 - 23:01.11] Speaker: P values might offer theoretical advantages in specific niche cases or
[23:01.11 - 23:01.12] Speaker: advantages in specific niche cases or
[23:01.12 - 23:03.35] Speaker: advantages in specific niche cases or with very few samples as some older
[23:03.35 - 23:03.36] Speaker: with very few samples as some older
[23:03.36 - 23:05.43] Speaker: with very few samples as some older research suggested once you have enough
[23:05.43 - 23:05.44] Speaker: research suggested once you have enough
[23:05.44 - 23:07.91] Speaker: research suggested once you have enough data the robustness of the P2 squaring
[23:07.91 - 23:07.92] Speaker: data the robustness of the P2 squaring
[23:07.92 - 23:10.07] Speaker: data the robustness of the P2 squaring operation often wins out for overall
[23:10.07 - 23:10.08] Speaker: operation often wins out for overall
[23:10.08 - 23:10.71] Speaker: operation often wins out for overall performance.
[23:10.71 - 23:10.72] Speaker: performance.
[23:10.72 - 23:12.31] Speaker: performance. &gt;&gt; The simplifies things for designers
[23:12.31 - 23:12.32] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The simplifies things for designers
[23:12.32 - 23:14.15] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The simplifies things for designers doesn't it? For many practical systems
[23:14.15 - 23:14.16] Speaker: doesn't it? For many practical systems
[23:14.16 - 23:16.23] Speaker: doesn't it? For many practical systems sticking with P2 might be the best bet.
[23:16.23 - 23:16.24] Speaker: sticking with P2 might be the best bet.
[23:16.24 - 23:18.55] Speaker: sticking with P2 might be the best bet. It certainly suggests that yes, it
[23:18.55 - 23:18.56] Speaker: It certainly suggests that yes, it
[23:18.56 - 23:20.63] Speaker: It certainly suggests that yes, it implies the conventional ED is actually
[23:20.63 - 23:20.64] Speaker: implies the conventional ED is actually
[23:20.64 - 23:22.95] Speaker: implies the conventional ED is actually quite optimal when you can afford a
[23:22.95 - 23:22.96] Speaker: quite optimal when you can afford a
[23:22.96 - 23:24.47] Speaker: quite optimal when you can afford a reasonable number of samples.
[23:24.47 - 23:24.48] Speaker: reasonable number of samples.
[23:24.48 - 23:25.99] Speaker: reasonable number of samples. &gt;&gt; Okay. What about comparing the two
[23:25.99 - 23:26.00] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. What about comparing the two
[23:26.00 - 23:28.47] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Okay. What about comparing the two diversity schemes head-to-head? PLC
[23:28.47 - 23:28.48] Speaker: diversity schemes head-to-head? PLC
[23:28.48 - 23:31.11] Speaker: diversity schemes head-to-head? PLC combining versus PLS selection. Which
[23:31.11 - 23:31.12] Speaker: combining versus PLS selection. Which
[23:31.12 - 23:33.27] Speaker: combining versus PLS selection. Which one generally performed better overall?
[23:33.27 - 23:33.28] Speaker: one generally performed better overall?
[23:33.28 - 23:35.43] Speaker: one generally performed better overall? &gt;&gt; The results showed that PLC diversity,
[23:35.43 - 23:35.44] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The results showed that PLC diversity,
[23:35.44 - 23:37.51] Speaker: &gt;&gt; The results showed that PLC diversity, the combining method, generally performs
[23:37.51 - 23:37.52] Speaker: the combining method, generally performs
[23:37.52 - 23:38.95] Speaker: the combining method, generally performs better than pls diversity,
[23:38.95 - 23:38.96] Speaker: better than pls diversity,
[23:38.96 - 23:40.39] Speaker: better than pls diversity, &gt;&gt; better detection probability.
[23:40.39 - 23:40.40] Speaker: &gt;&gt; better detection probability.
[23:40.40 - 23:43.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; better detection probability. &gt;&gt; Yes, they gave an example with P2 and
[23:43.67 - 23:43.68] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes, they gave an example with P2 and
[23:43.68 - 23:47.11] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes, they gave an example with P2 and N500 samples. PLC achieved about 30%
[23:47.11 - 23:47.12] Speaker: N500 samples. PLC achieved about 30%
[23:47.12 - 23:49.03] Speaker: N500 samples. PLC achieved about 30% higher detection probability than no
[23:49.03 - 23:49.04] Speaker: higher detection probability than no
[23:49.04 - 23:52.63] Speaker: higher detection probability than no diversity and crucially about 7.2%
[23:52.63 - 23:52.64] Speaker: diversity and crucially about 7.2%
[23:52.64 - 23:54.87] Speaker: diversity and crucially about 7.2% higher detection probability than pls
[23:54.87 - 23:54.88] Speaker: higher detection probability than pls
[23:54.88 - 23:56.55] Speaker: higher detection probability than pls under the same conditions.
[23:56.55 - 23:56.56] Speaker: under the same conditions.
[23:56.56 - 23:58.15] Speaker: under the same conditions. &gt;&gt; So adding up the information from all
[23:58.15 - 23:58.16] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So adding up the information from all
[23:58.16 - 23:59.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So adding up the information from all branches usually gives you a better
[23:59.67 - 23:59.68] Speaker: branches usually gives you a better
[23:59.68 - 24:01.19] Speaker: branches usually gives you a better result than just picking the best one.
[24:01.19 - 24:01.20] Speaker: result than just picking the best one.
[24:01.20 - 24:02.63] Speaker: result than just picking the best one. &gt;&gt; Generally, yes. It seems that
[24:02.63 - 24:02.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Generally, yes. It seems that
[24:02.64 - 24:04.63] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Generally, yes. It seems that aggregating the energy provides a more
[24:04.63 - 24:04.64] Speaker: aggregating the energy provides a more
[24:04.64 - 24:06.23] Speaker: aggregating the energy provides a more robust final statistic.
[24:06.23 - 24:06.24] Speaker: robust final statistic.
[24:06.24 - 24:07.19] Speaker: robust final statistic. &gt;&gt; But there was that interesting point
[24:07.19 - 24:07.20] Speaker: &gt;&gt; But there was that interesting point
[24:07.20 - 24:08.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; But there was that interesting point about what happens with tons of data,
[24:08.55 - 24:08.56] Speaker: about what happens with tons of data,
[24:08.56 - 24:10.31] Speaker: about what happens with tons of data, right? The asymtoic case.
[24:10.31 - 24:10.32] Speaker: right? The asymtoic case.
[24:10.32 - 24:12.47] Speaker: right? The asymtoic case. &gt;&gt; Yes, the aha moment. As the number of
[24:12.47 - 24:12.48] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes, the aha moment. As the number of
[24:12.48 - 24:14.23] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Yes, the aha moment. As the number of samples n goes towards infinity,
[24:14.23 - 24:14.24] Speaker: samples n goes towards infinity,
[24:14.24 - 24:16.23] Speaker: samples n goes towards infinity, &gt;&gt; which is theoretical but tells us about
[24:16.23 - 24:16.24] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which is theoretical but tells us about
[24:16.24 - 24:17.59] Speaker: &gt;&gt; which is theoretical but tells us about fundamental limits.
[24:17.59 - 24:17.60] Speaker: fundamental limits.
[24:17.60 - 24:20.79] Speaker: fundamental limits. &gt;&gt; Exactly. As n gets extremely large, two
[24:20.79 - 24:20.80] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. As n gets extremely large, two
[24:20.80 - 24:23.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Exactly. As n gets extremely large, two things happen. First, the detection
[24:23.19 - 24:23.20] Speaker: things happen. First, the detection
[24:23.20 - 24:24.71] Speaker: things happen. First, the detection performance of the GED becomes
[24:24.71 - 24:24.72] Speaker: performance of the GED becomes
[24:24.72 - 24:27.51] Speaker: performance of the GED becomes independent of P. The choice of exponent
[24:27.51 - 24:27.52] Speaker: independent of P. The choice of exponent
[24:27.52 - 24:28.55] Speaker: independent of P. The choice of exponent doesn't matter anymore.
[24:28.55 - 24:28.56] Speaker: doesn't matter anymore.
[24:28.56 - 24:31.11] Speaker: doesn't matter anymore. &gt;&gt; So P2, P3, whatever, they all converge.
[24:31.11 - 24:31.12] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So P2, P3, whatever, they all converge.
[24:31.12 - 24:32.71] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So P2, P3, whatever, they all converge. &gt;&gt; They converge in performance. And
[24:32.71 - 24:32.72] Speaker: &gt;&gt; They converge in performance. And
[24:32.72 - 24:35.27] Speaker: &gt;&gt; They converge in performance. And second, the performance of both PLC and
[24:35.27 - 24:35.28] Speaker: second, the performance of both PLC and
[24:35.28 - 24:37.67] Speaker: second, the performance of both PLC and PLS diversity schemes becomes almost the
[24:37.67 - 24:37.68] Speaker: PLS diversity schemes becomes almost the
[24:37.68 - 24:38.23] Speaker: PLS diversity schemes becomes almost the same.
[24:38.23 - 24:38.24] Speaker: same.
[24:38.24 - 24:40.63] Speaker: same. &gt;&gt; Wow. So with infinite data, it doesn't
[24:40.63 - 24:40.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Wow. So with infinite data, it doesn't
[24:40.64 - 24:42.87] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Wow. So with infinite data, it doesn't matter if you combine or select and it
[24:42.87 - 24:42.88] Speaker: matter if you combine or select and it
[24:42.88 - 24:44.39] Speaker: matter if you combine or select and it doesn't matter what P you use.
[24:44.39 - 24:44.40] Speaker: doesn't matter what P you use.
[24:44.40 - 24:46.63] Speaker: doesn't matter what P you use. &gt;&gt; Essentially, yes. The sheer amount of
[24:46.63 - 24:46.64] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Essentially, yes. The sheer amount of
[24:46.64 - 24:48.31] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Essentially, yes. The sheer amount of information dominates any subtle
[24:48.31 - 24:48.32] Speaker: information dominates any subtle
[24:48.32 - 24:50.39] Speaker: information dominates any subtle differences in the processing method. It
[24:50.39 - 24:50.40] Speaker: differences in the processing method. It
[24:50.40 - 24:51.83] Speaker: differences in the processing method. It implies that for systems that can
[24:51.83 - 24:51.84] Speaker: implies that for systems that can
[24:51.84 - 24:53.99] Speaker: implies that for systems that can integrate over very long times, the
[24:53.99 - 24:54.00] Speaker: integrate over very long times, the
[24:54.00 - 24:56.15] Speaker: integrate over very long times, the specific detector design choices become
[24:56.15 - 24:56.16] Speaker: specific detector design choices become
[24:56.16 - 24:57.35] Speaker: specific detector design choices become less critical.
[24:57.35 - 24:57.36] Speaker: less critical.
[24:57.36 - 24:59.35] Speaker: less critical. &gt;&gt; Fascinating. Now, maybe the biggest
[24:59.35 - 24:59.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Fascinating. Now, maybe the biggest

[25:12.56 - 25:14.31] Speaker: versus the impact of fading on the GED's performance, and the result might
[25:14.31 - 25:14.32] Speaker: performance, and the result might
[25:14.32 - 25:16.15] Speaker: performance, and the result might challenge some long-held assumptions.
[25:16.15 - 25:16.16] Speaker: challenge some long-held assumptions.
[25:16.16 - 25:16.71] Speaker: challenge some long-held assumptions. &gt;&gt; How so?
[25:16.71 - 25:16.72] Speaker: &gt;&gt; How so?
[25:16.72 - 25:18.55] Speaker: &gt;&gt; How so? &gt;&gt; For certain levels of noise uncertainty,

[25:18.56 - 25:20.15] Speaker: &gt;&gt; For certain levels of noise uncertainty, its negative effect on detection
[25:20.15 - 25:20.16] Speaker: its negative effect on detection
[25:20.16 - 25:21.91] Speaker: its negative effect on detection performance is actually more severe than

[25:23.35 - 25:23.36] Speaker: the effect of fading alone.
[25:23.36 - 25:25.75] Speaker: the effect of fading alone. &gt;&gt; Really worse than fading. Fading gets so
[25:25.75 - 25:25.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Really worse than fading. Fading gets so
[25:25.76 - 25:27.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; Really worse than fading. Fading gets so much attention in wireless design.
[25:27.19 - 25:27.20] Speaker: much attention in wireless design.

[25:42.87 - 25:42.88] Speaker: to having only fading present with M2.
[25:42.88 - 25:45.51] Speaker: to having only fading present with M2. &gt;&gt; That is a huge difference. It suggests
[25:45.51 - 25:45.52] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That is a huge difference. It suggests
[25:45.52 - 25:47.11] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That is a huge difference. It suggests maybe we haven't paid enough attention
[25:47.11 - 25:47.12] Speaker: maybe we haven't paid enough attention
[25:47.12 - 25:49.75] Speaker: maybe we haven't paid enough attention to accurately characterizing and
[25:49.75 - 25:49.76] Speaker: to accurately characterizing and
[25:49.76 - 25:52.31] Speaker: to accurately characterizing and mitigating noise uncertainty.
[25:52.31 - 25:52.32] Speaker: mitigating noise uncertainty.
[25:52.32 - 25:54.07] Speaker: mitigating noise uncertainty. &gt;&gt; That's a strong implication. While
[25:54.07 - 25:54.08] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a strong implication. While
[25:54.08 - 25:56.39] Speaker: &gt;&gt; That's a strong implication. While fading is undeniably a problem, this
[25:56.39 - 25:56.40] Speaker: fading is undeniably a problem, this
[25:56.40 - 25:58.31] Speaker: fading is undeniably a problem, this research suggests that NU can be the
[25:58.31 - 25:58.32] Speaker: research suggests that NU can be the
[25:58.32 - 25:59.91] Speaker: research suggests that NU can be the dominant limiting factor in some
[25:59.91 - 25:59.92] Speaker: dominant limiting factor in some
[25:59.92 - 26:02.79] Speaker: dominant limiting factor in some realistic scenarios. Ignoring it or
[26:02.79 - 26:02.80] Speaker: realistic scenarios. Ignoring it or
[26:02.80 - 26:04.71] Speaker: realistic scenarios. Ignoring it or assuming it's negligible could lead to
[26:04.71 - 26:04.72] Speaker: assuming it's negligible could lead to
[26:04.72 - 26:06.79] Speaker: assuming it's negligible could lead to designs that significantly underperform
[26:06.79 - 26:06.80] Speaker: designs that significantly underperform
[26:06.80 - 26:08.15] Speaker: designs that significantly underperform in the real world.
[26:08.15 - 26:08.16] Speaker: in the real world.
[26:08.16 - 26:09.75] Speaker: in the real world. &gt;&gt; And of course, performance is worse when
[26:09.75 - 26:09.76] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And of course, performance is worse when
[26:09.76 - 26:11.83] Speaker: &gt;&gt; And of course, performance is worse when you have both NU and fading together
[26:11.83 - 26:11.84] Speaker: you have both NU and fading together
[26:11.84 - 26:13.83] Speaker: you have both NU and fading together &gt;&gt; predictably. Yes, that's the toughest
[26:13.83 - 26:13.84] Speaker: &gt;&gt; predictably. Yes, that's the toughest
[26:13.84 - 26:15.91] Speaker: &gt;&gt; predictably. Yes, that's the toughest but also the most realistic scenario.
[26:15.91 - 26:15.92] Speaker: but also the most realistic scenario.
[26:15.92 - 26:17.59] Speaker: but also the most realistic scenario. &gt;&gt; So the big implication here is
[26:17.59 - 26:17.60] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So the big implication here is
[26:17.60 - 26:19.43] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So the big implication here is &gt;&gt; engineers really need to focus on
[26:19.43 - 26:19.44] Speaker: &gt;&gt; engineers really need to focus on
[26:19.44 - 26:21.27] Speaker: &gt;&gt; engineers really need to focus on understanding and mitigating noise
[26:21.27 - 26:21.28] Speaker: understanding and mitigating noise
[26:21.28 - 26:23.75] Speaker: understanding and mitigating noise uncertainty. It's not a secondary
[26:23.75 - 26:23.76] Speaker: uncertainty. It's not a secondary
[26:23.76 - 26:25.99] Speaker: uncertainty. It's not a secondary effect. It can be a primary bottleneck,
[26:25.99 - 26:26.00] Speaker: effect. It can be a primary bottleneck,
[26:26.00 - 26:27.51] Speaker: effect. It can be a primary bottleneck, sometimes even more damaging than
[26:27.51 - 26:27.52] Speaker: sometimes even more damaging than
[26:27.52 - 26:29.67] Speaker: sometimes even more damaging than fading. Techniques for better noise
[26:29.67 - 26:29.68] Speaker: fading. Techniques for better noise
[26:29.68 - 26:31.91] Speaker: fading. Techniques for better noise estimation, calibration, and designing
[26:31.91 - 26:31.92] Speaker: estimation, calibration, and designing
[26:31.92 - 26:34.63] Speaker: estimation, calibration, and designing detectors robust to NU are critical for
[26:34.63 - 26:34.64] Speaker: detectors robust to NU are critical for
[26:34.64 - 26:36.63] Speaker: detectors robust to NU are critical for reliable cognitive radio and maybe
[26:36.63 - 26:36.64] Speaker: reliable cognitive radio and maybe
[26:36.64 - 26:39.67] Speaker: reliable cognitive radio and maybe wireless systems in general. # tagoutro.

[27:06.00 - 27:08.15] Speaker: primarily by noise uncertainty &gt;&gt; a fundamental limit. Yeah. But we also
[27:08.15 - 27:08.16] Speaker: &gt;&gt; a fundamental limit. Yeah. But we also
[27:08.16 - 27:09.67] Speaker: &gt;&gt; a fundamental limit. Yeah. But we also saw how clever techniques like
[27:09.67 - 27:09.68] Speaker: saw how clever techniques like
[27:09.68 - 27:11.91] Speaker: saw how clever techniques like diversity, especially PLC combining, can
[27:11.91 - 27:11.92] Speaker: diversity, especially PLC combining, can
[27:11.92 - 27:13.75] Speaker: diversity, especially PLC combining, can help us fight back against that wall
[27:13.75 - 27:13.76] Speaker: help us fight back against that wall
[27:13.76 - 27:15.75] Speaker: help us fight back against that wall even when facing both noise uncertainty

[27:23.52 - 27:25.99] Speaker: &gt;&gt; I'd say first that surprising severity of noise uncertainty. It can be more
[27:25.99 - 27:26.00] Speaker: of noise uncertainty. It can be more
[27:26.00 - 27:27.99] Speaker: of noise uncertainty. It can be more detrimental than fading sometimes, which
[27:27.99 - 27:28.00] Speaker: detrimental than fading sometimes, which
[27:28.00 - 27:30.07] Speaker: detrimental than fading sometimes, which really shifts the focus for designers.

[28:05.35 - 28:05.36] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It absolutely does. It shows that
[28:05.36 - 28:06.79] Speaker: &gt;&gt; It absolutely does. It shows that pushing the boundaries of wireless
[28:06.79 - 28:06.80] Speaker: pushing the boundaries of wireless
[28:06.80 - 28:08.47] Speaker: pushing the boundaries of wireless communication isn't just about brute
[28:08.47 - 28:08.48] Speaker: communication isn't just about brute
[28:08.48 - 28:10.55] Speaker: communication isn't just about brute force. It's about deeply understanding
[28:10.55 - 28:10.56] Speaker: force. It's about deeply understanding
[28:10.56 - 28:11.91] Speaker: force. It's about deeply understanding these fundamental limits and finding
[28:11.91 - 28:11.92] Speaker: these fundamental limits and finding
[28:11.92 - 28:13.59] Speaker: these fundamental limits and finding smart ways to work around them.

[28:13.60 - 28:15.19] Speaker: smart ways to work around them. &gt;&gt; So, let's leave everyone with a final
[28:15.19 - 28:15.20] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, let's leave everyone with a final
[28:15.20 - 28:17.19] Speaker: &gt;&gt; So, let's leave everyone with a final thought to chew on. Given these
[28:17.19 - 28:17.20] Speaker: thought to chew on. Given these

[28:33.60 - 28:35.75] Speaker: amounts of spectrum that we currently consider unusable because the signals
[28:35.75 - 28:35.76] Speaker: consider unusable because the signals
[28:35.76 - 28:37.27] Speaker: consider unusable because the signals are just too close to that uncertain
[28:37.27 - 28:37.28] Speaker: are just too close to that uncertain
[28:37.28 - 28:40.39] Speaker: are just too close to that uncertain noise floor? Could tackling NU be a key
