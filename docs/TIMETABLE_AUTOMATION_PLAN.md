# 🎯 GTU Diploma Engineering - Automated Timetable Generation Plan

## 📋 Project Overview

**Objective**: Transform the manual faculty preference collection and course allocation process into a fully automated timetable generation system for GTU diploma engineering programs.

**Current State**: Manual workflow where faculty submit 3-4 course preferences for ECE/ICT programs (semesters 1,3,5) to meet 18-hour weekly workload with seniority-based priority allocation.

**Target State**: Fully automated system with AI-driven optimization, conflict resolution, and multi-stakeholder timetable views.
