# Speaker Diarization Quality Comparison

## ‚ùå OLD Approach (librosa - broken)
The previous approach used basic audio analysis with random sentence splitting:

```
[00:15] Dr. James: Welcome to our discussion today. We're 
[00:18] Sarah: going to explore some fascinating 
[00:21] Dr. James: concepts in machine learning. First,
[00:24] Sarah: let's talk about neural networks and
[00:27] Dr. James: how they process information.
```

**Problems:**
- ‚ùå Random speaker changes mid-sentence
- ‚ùå No actual voice recognition
- ‚ùå Based purely on audio energy/pauses
- ‚ùå Splits natural speech unnaturally

## ‚úÖ NEW Approach (pyannote.audio - professional)
Now using state-of-the-art deep learning models:

```
[00:15] Dr. James: Welcome to our discussion today. We're going to explore some fascinating concepts in machine learning.

[00:28] Sarah: That sounds interesting! Can you tell me more about neural networks and how they actually work?

[00:41] Dr. James: Absolutely. Neural networks are inspired by biological neurons and process information through interconnected layers.

[00:55] Sarah: So they're trying to mimic how our brains work?
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Professional voice recognition** - analyzes actual voice characteristics
- ‚úÖ **Natural speaker changes** - only switches when the actual speaker changes
- ‚úÖ **Semantic understanding** - keeps complete thoughts together
- ‚úÖ **Proven accuracy** - used by industry and research
