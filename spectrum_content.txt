From the desk of Principal
Technology is the fuel for the society; it provides means to
ease human lives, and Government Polytechnic, Palanpur is
one of the institutes that provide skilled and ethical
engineers to the society. This institute runs basic to advance
engineering programs. Electronics and communication
engineering department is one which stands ahead in terms
of technology and advancements. The department is well
equipped with the resources to prepare competent and
industry ready EC engineers catering the needs of
industries, innovators, and entrepreneurs with moral
values. It is my great pleasure to see the first band (Volume
1) of the “Spectrum”, e-newsletter of Electronics and
Communication Department being published.

From the desk of Head of Department
Electronics and communication engineering field has
witnessed the evolution of semiconductor from vacuum
tubes to MOSFETs, from telephones to 5G smart
phones. Continuing the evolutionary tradition of the
branch, it gives me immense pleasure to present its first
yearly newsletter “Spectrum”. Spectrum intends to
provide a platform for faculties, students, and all other
stakeholders to share and receive news of latest updates
of the activities carried out in the department. This
newsletter will also be publishing achievements of staff
members and students. I expect students to take the
‘Spectrum’ to new heights. A lot of hard work has gone into publishing this, and every
stakeholder’s involvement will encourage us further. I extend my full cooperation and
best wishes to the entire team behind Spectrum

Tech Talk
Device to device communication in 5G
Introduction of Android as an operating system and open source software’s, free wares
and ample of bandwidth-hungry applications results in scarcity of spectrum for
communication. The growth of mobile devices, voice, and video over IP (VoIP) resulted
in an exponential growth of data traffic; mobile data traffic expected to increase 1000
times over ten years. The forecast says that the 100 billion devices would be connected
by 2030 by the onset of the internet of things. The massive increment in the connected
devices causes overcrowded electromagnetic spectrum. In the 5G device to device,
communication provides a prominent solution. Device to device communication (D2D)
is defined as the communication among devices in close proximity, open to use cellular
licensed as well as unlicensed frequency spectrum without the need to traverse the core
network.

Use cases of D2D communication

D2D communication is a prime technology of 5G, which supports a variety of use cases
as described in above figure. D2D communication will be an alternative to mobile
communication demanding higher rate services as vehicular communication, content
distribution in conferences, concerts, gaming, cellular offloading, relaying of data, and
advertisement broadcasting in the streets. The use case of D2D communication of
significance is public safety and disaster.

The devices close to, enables higher throughput, lower latency, lower transmission
power, higher data rate and higher spectral efficiency and energy efficiency.
D2D communication exists on unlicensed as well as on the licensed frequency spectrum.
Majority of the research is on the licensed spectrum (inband D2D) as it provides a
higher level of security. Resources of cellular devices reused by the D2D devices in
inband D2D communication (underlay inband D2D).

Reusing the resources certainly improves the spectral efficiency, but interference
between the D2D user and cellular user introduced nevertheless. The eventual
reduction in the spectral efficiency by using part of dedicated licensed spectrum for D2D
users, however, provides fairness in provisioning of resources to D2D users and cellular
users (overlay inband D2D). There are researchers recommending the use of unlicensed
band for D2D users with Wi-Fi direct or Bluetooth (outband D2D) against licensed
spectrum. The complexity increases in unlicensed spectrum, on account of interference.
Above figure summarizes the D2D communication with respect to the spectrum usage.
