## Notes
- Each test suite will be recreated with proper mocking and implementation
- Tests will follow established patterns from existing working test suites
- All tests must pass before moving to the next suite
- Focus on comprehensive coverage while maintaining test reliability

## Current Task
Next: Create test suite for `src/app/__tests__/page.test.tsx` (Landing page)
