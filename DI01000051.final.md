| Rationale:      | The engineering diploma holders are required to use and maintain various types of  electronically controlled equipment. The fundamental  principles of electronics are  to be applied in most of the situations to arrive at the probable solutions which is  faced  in  the  world  of  work,  therefore  the  knowledge  of  the  functions  of  various  basic  electronic  devices  and  components  and  practical  skills  acquired  through  the  laboratory experiments will help them, when they work with electronic equipment  and its sub-circuits. This course is designed to develop the skills to use the basics  electronic  components  and  apply  the  knowledge  to  maintain  the  various  types  of  electronic circuits. |

## Note:

- i. More Practical  Exercises  can  be  designed  and  offered  by  the  respective  course  teacher  to develop  the  industry  relevant  skills/outcomes  to  match  the  COs.  The  above  table  is  only  a suggestive list.
- ii. Care must be taken in assigning and assessing study report as it is a first year study report. Study report, data collection and analysis report must be assigned in a group. Teacher has to discuss  about  type of  data  (which  and  why)  before  group  start  their  market  survey.  The following are some sample 'Process' and 'Product' related skills (more may be added/deleted depending  on  the  course)  that  occur in  the  above  listed  Practical  Exercises  of  this  course required which are embedded in the COs and ultimately the competency.

## Suggested Project List:

Only one micro-project is planned to be undertaken by a student that needs to be assigned to him/her in the beginning of the semester. In the first four semesters, the micro-project are groupbased (group of 3 to  5). However, in the fifth and sixth semesters , the number of students in the group should not exceed three .

The  micro-project  could  be  industry  application  based,  internet-based,  workshop-based,  laboratorybased  or field-based.  Each  micro-project  should  encompass  two  or  more  COs  which  are  in  fact,  an integration of PrOs, UOs and ADOs. Each student will have to maintain dated work diary consisting of individual contribution  in  the  project  work  and  give  a  seminar presentation  of  it  before  submission. The  duration  of the  microproject  should  be  about 14-16 (fourteen to sixteen) student engagement hours during  the  course.  The  students  ought  to  submit  micro-project  by  the  end  of  the  semester  to develop the industry- oriented COs. A suggestive list of micro-projects is given here. This has to match the competency and the COs.

Similar micro-projects could be added by the concerned course teacher:

- a) Diode: Build a circuit on general purpose PCB or breadboard to obtain +12V unregulated DC power  supply using full wave bridge rectifier and filter (Duration: 8- 10 hours)
- b) Photodiode : Build a interruption detector circuit to blink an LED using LDR, and prepare a mini project  report. ((Duration: 6-8 hours)
- c) Transistor Amplifier : a common emitter amplifier using transistor and prepare a mini project report.  (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- d) Transistor Application: Build a transistorized water level indicator and prepare a mini project report.  (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- e) Special  Purpose  Diodes: Build  basic  applications  using  any  one  or  combination  of  special purpose  diodes , and prepare a mini project report. (Duration: 6-8 hours)
- f) 555 Timer : Build a circuit on a breadboad using 555 timer to generator square with variable duty cycle  and frequency. ( Duration: 6-8 hours)

## Suggested Activities for Students:

Other  than  the  classroom  and  laboratory  learning,  following  are  the  suggested  student-related cocurricular activities which can be undertaken to accelerate the attainment of the various outcomes in this course: Students should perform following activities in group and prepare reports of about 5 pages for  each  activity.  They  should  also  collect/record  physical  evidences  for  their  (student's)  portfolio which may be useful for their placement interviews:

- a) Prepare a table and interpret the technical specification of various diodes and transistors using data sheet.
- b) Prepare specifications of some electronic components.
- c) Collect information and seminar on any relevant topic related with the course.
- d) Undertake a market survey of different semiconductor components.
- e) Identify various types of transistor
- f) Analysis of 555 Times circuits
