      content: "On December 15, 2023, we lost one of the greatest faculty members of our EC Department, Shri Nikunj M Patel, after a brief illness. His departure has left an irreplaceable void in our hearts and our institution. Nikunj sir was not just an educator; he was a mentor, a guide, and a friend to countless students who walked through our department doors.\n\nHis down-to-earth nature made every student feel comfortable approaching him with their doubts and concerns. Whether it was academic guidance, career counseling, or personal support, he was always there with a warm smile and helpful words. His commitment to any task he undertook was exemplary - he approached every responsibility with dedication and integrity that inspired all of us.\n\nShri Nikunj M Patel believed in nurturing not just technical skills but also human values. He taught us that true success comes from helping others succeed. His legacy lives on in every student he mentored, every colleague he supported, and every life he touched with his kindness and wisdom.\n\nThough he may have left us physically, his teachings, his values, and his spirit continue to guide us. We remember him not with sorrow, but with gratitude for having had the privilege of working alongside such a remarkable human being.\n\nRest in peace, dear sir. Your memory will forever be cherished in the EC Department family.",

      message: `Dear Students, Faculty, and Stakeholders,

The academic year 2023-24 has been a year of remarkable achievements and growth for our Electronics & Communication Engineering Department. I am proud to share our collective successes that reflect our commitment to excellence and innovation.

Our students have demonstrated exceptional academic performance, with achievers like Maknojiya Arman Imranbhai (8.95 SPI) and Patel Dev Kiritbhai (9.62 SPI) leading the way. This academic excellence translated into outstanding placement success, achieving a 67% placement rate with students securing positions at prestigious organizations like Micron Technology and TDSC, with packages reaching ₹3.72 lakhs.

Our industry-academia collaboration flourished through expert sessions on embedded systems and web development, industrial visits to Bajrang Paper Products and PCB Power, and participation in premier events like SEMICON 2023 and SEMIX training at IIT Bombay. The plasma knowledge camp by Institute of Plasma Research, Gandhinagar, further enriched our students' scientific exposure.

Faculty excellence was highlighted by Mr. Nirav J. Chauhan's research presentation at ICETCP 2024, while our comprehensive skill development initiatives included RTL design workshops, solar cell fabrication training, and safety programs. We also embraced holistic development through cultural celebrations, community engagement in "New Palanpur for New India 2.0," health awareness campaigns, and environmental initiatives.

This year, we also honored the memory of our beloved colleague Shri Nikunj M Patel, whose dedication and values continue to inspire our community. His legacy reminds us that true education encompasses both technical excellence and character building.

As we move forward, our focus remains on nurturing industry-ready engineers who are technically competent, ethically grounded, and socially responsible. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to all who contributed to making 2023-24 a year of exceptional progress.

With continued commitment to excellence.`
