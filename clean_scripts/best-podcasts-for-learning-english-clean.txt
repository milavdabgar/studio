Dr. James: Many of you ask me how can I improve my listening or what should I listen to. For years I've been collecting the best of the best and today I'm finally sharing my ultimate list with you. We'll start with the absolute essentials for beginners, move on to the podcast that will make you sound more natural and finish with a few that will help you think and even laugh in English. First one on the list is BBC Learning English. Now this is on the top of the list for a reason. I really love it. I have truly enjoyed the format that they have and there's something very special about the episodes that are there on this podcast. This isn't just any learning program. It's from the BBC, a world leader in broadcasting as you know.

Dr. James: That means you're getting incredibly highquality audio professional presenters and context that's been carefully designed by language experts. It's the gold standard. It's actually one of the best ones out there. And don't go anywhere.

Sarah: I've got really good ones ahead in this video, too.

Dr. James: So, just hold on. Wait till the end and you're going to find out the 10 best podcast in the industry on YouTube and elsewhere to learn English from. Podcast is the way the world is progressing. This is a massive hit on YouTube and otherwise on Spotify and God knows what all channels. People are listening to podcast everywhere. So I feel learning English through a podcast is a brilliant idea because you can do it while driving. You of course you need to focus on your driving but since you play radio this could be on the radio right this could just play in the background and you can absorb it naturally the language so BBC Learning English is a longunning branch of the British Broadcasting Corporation which is BBC dedicated to helping non-native speakers improve their English skills.

Dr. James: Now here are the special pointers about this podcast. Under the BBC Learning English umbrella, there are several miniseries aimed at different aspects of language learning like vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation, etc. My personal favorite is their sixinut English series. They're really nice episodes. In just 6 minutes, you get a topical conversation between two presenters, a breakdown of key vocabulary, and a question of the week. It's the most efficient 6 minutes of English learning you can get. You can choose your level between easy, medium, and hard. Each episode is fairly short, about 3 to six minutes, making it easy to fit into a busy schedule. Produced by the BBC, it includes segments on current events, interviews, and everyday conversations.

Dr. James: Each episode focuses on a specific grammar or vocabulary topic and uses real news clips. The show also emphasizes pronunciation and intonation. This is where you can follow and find out where these podcasts are available. I'm going to be listing them down somewhere here, okay? And every single link is available in the description of this video. So do not hesitate to click on the description of the video. It is filled with gold links and gold information really helpful for your English learning journey. So of course they are available on their website and their app. But apart from that you can also listen to it on Apple podcast, Spotify etc. Moving on to the next one which is Voice of America Va Learning English. This podcast is designed for non-native speakers, people like me and you, okay?

Dr. James: Using simplified vocabulary and slower paced speech to enhance understanding and build confidence in listening skills, especially if the BBC is your gateway to British English, VA essential resource for American English. You may wonder, ma'am, do we need to specifically focus on British, American, and all these different accents? Personally talking about myself, I am really fluent in listening and understanding American English. Okay, I am not saying that I can speak in that accent. Of course, I cannot because I've not lived there. I haven't been to America too. But okay, that has no meaning whatsoever here because you don't go to a place and you learn the accent. You have to live in that area for many years to absorb their accent.

Dr. James: So of course I do not speak those accents but I'm very comfortable in understanding American English and I am getting better at understanding British English too. Their accent and Australian accent I personally find Australian accent a bit difficult but American is like peanuts.

Sarah: It's very easy now because I've seen I don't know some thousands of episodes of different shows and movies. I don't need captions anymore. I am very good to go without captions in movies and in shows for British and American English.

Dr. James: But when it comes to Australian, yeah, I might choose to switch those on, but I don't think I usually watch too many Australian shows. I do read Australian books, but Australian authors, but not too many shows. Now, here's the special information about this podcast. It is produced by the US government's official external broadcaster. So again, you're getting trusted, highquality content. It offers different series and segments such as words and their stories and English in a minute that focus on vocabulary building, pronunciation, and practical language use. They don't just speak slowly. They use a slightly limited core vocabulary of about 1500 words. This is a deliberate teaching method. Deliberate, I mean it's intentional.

Dr. James: They want to keep it to a limited vocabulary because they want you to exercise and practice those words.

Dr. James: Okay? It allows you to build a strong foundation and gain confidence without feeling overwhelmed. It's like learning to swim in the shallow end of the pool before diving into the deep. You get it? Check out their series American Stories. They adapt classic short stories from famous American authors like Edgar Alen Poe and Mark Twain into simplified English. It's a brilliant way to absorb culture and language at the same time. Now, here are the special pointers. They use slowerpaced speech. Podcasts are accompanied by creatively produced videos. Episodes deal with current events, science, culture, and so much more. So, you get both language practice and knowledge of the topic. It is helpful for newcomers who want to build listening confidence especially.

Dr. James: It is available on their website learnenglish. vo. com. learnenglish. vo. com.

Sarah: And apart from that, Apple podcast, Spotify, Google podcast. Next one on the list is The English We Speak by BBC. So this is another one by BBC, but of course it is different from the one that I spoke about right in the beginning of the video. The English we speak helps you to stay on top of the latest English words and phrases. So this is more about the latest trending stuff. The episodes are under 3 minutes long and focus mainly on building English vocabulary.

Dr. James: Now, this is my secret weapon for all of you who want to stop sounding like a textbook and start sounding like a native speaker. It teaches you the idioms and slang that people actually use in conversation.

Sarah: For example, instead of saying it's very expensive, you learn to say it cost an arm and a leg because each episode is hyperfocused on just one phrase. It's incredibly easy to remember. You listen for 3 minutes, you learn one new expression and you can start using it that same day. It's the most high impact, loweffort podcast on this list.

Dr. James: So just 3 minute long episodes. Easy, easy breezy. It's just 3 minute long episodes which focus on a single English phrase or idiom per episode. I love the idea. I love the concept. Excellent for quick listening practice and building up your bank of everyday expressions. easy to binge listen and revisit particular phrases whenever needed. So you could do probably four or five in a day. I think two or three minimum you can do for sure. But yes, if you can stretch it a little, five a day would be what cost you about 15 16 minutes of your time which is nothing but of course it's harder to remember those many expressions if you learn them in one single go.

Dr. James: So yes, I think ideally it should be two to three statement which is two to three podcast which is what 9 minutes 10 minutes of your day nothing.

Sarah: You know, and then when you learn those phrases or you learn those words, just make sure that you practice them the same day. Many people ask me this on a very regular basis that ma'am you teach all these new words and we love them when we hear them and it's fascinating but we just can't recall them at the right time and we forget about those words. See for vocabulary it's important that you understand anybody who speaks really good or is very fluent in English or masters amazing vocabulary like Shashi Tur and people like these what we need to understand that the words that they speak are actually way fewer than the words they actually know.

Dr. James: So your active vocabulary will always be smaller than your passive vocabulary. Passive vocabulary is a huge massive bank of words that you've heard of, you understand, but they don't come to your mind when you have to speak to somebody.

Dr. James: And that's okay. You know, it happens the same way with everybody. Gradually, when you hear the word over and over again, it starts to fall into the category of active vocabulary and move away from your passive vocabulary. Here is your availability. You can go to bbc. co. uk/arningenglish bbc. co. uk/arningenglish UK/arning English or the rest of the resources on the screen. Just choose, okay? Amaze your friends, impress your teachers and parents with the fantastic words and phrases you learn with this podcast. Go ahead. Next one on the list is ESL Pod, English as a second language. So ESL is Pod is podcast. This podcast is an absolute legend in the English learning world. It's been around since 2005. Means there is a massive archive of over 1,800 episodes.

Dr. James: Whatever situation you need to practice, from ordering a coffee to negotiating a contract, there's an ESL Pod episode for it. It's been around for many years, ESL Pod has built a dedicated listener base. Every episode has a brilliant two-part structure. First, you hear a dialogue at a very slow speed. Then, the host, Dr. Jeff McQuillin breaks down every single word and phrase, okay? He explains it to you.

Sarah: Finally, you hear the same dialogue again at a normal natural speed. This slow then fast method is incredibly effective for training your ear. Now, here are the special pointers. Episodes are built around situational dialogues like visiting a restaurant, speaking in a meeting. It features slow, clearly inunciated speech in plain language which makes it easy to listen to and understand. Vocabulary and phrases are repeated multiple times within an episode to reinforce learning. The podcast typically includes explanations of vocabulary and expressions. Now this is the availability eslpod.com or you could go to Apple podcast, Spotify, Google podcast. Next one on the list is real life English podcast. The beyond the classroom philosophy is what they follow. I'll tell you what it is.

Dr. James: Okay, what I'm talking about. The moto of real life English is to help you learn English from the world, not from a textbook. Okay, this podcast feels less like a lesson and it feels more like you're hanging out with cool international friends who happen to be teaching you English. These conversations on the episodes are fun.

Sarah: They're modern. the full of energy. It's not just a podcast. It's a global movement. They have a huge community and an app called Real Life English where you can connect with other learners and practice speaking for free.

Once you listen to one of the episodes, you'll know why I'm saying this. Luke's English podcast. Let's be honest, learning can sometimes be boring. Luke's English podcast is the antidote to that. Luke Thompson is a qualified teacher, but he's also a stand-up comedian. That's the special part of this.

Sarah: The result is a podcast that is genuinely hilarious. You'll be learning complex grammar, vocabulary through stories about his life, and funny observations. You'll be laughing so much that you'll forget that you're even studying. With over 900 episodes, many of which are over an hour long, this is a deep dive.

They have chatterbox which is a totally natural conversation between native speakers. Okay. Then there is catch word which is a deep dive into one specific idiom or expression. Okay. And then you have simplified speech which is similar to VA but with more natural topics. Okay. You can pick the style that works best for you. Choose yourself. Many podcasts are either British or American but the host of Qulips are Canadian. This gives you fantastic exposure to a very clear, neutral, and widely understood North American accent. Okay.
