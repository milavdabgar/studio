This is enterprise Java architecture used in production systems handling billions of dollars in financial transactions.

[click] The legal header is mandatory for all Fortune 500 enterprise code. Companies like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan require copyright notices, security classifications, and compliance certifications on every source file. This protects intellectual property worth millions of dollars.

[click] Enterprise package structure follows domain-driven design. The deep package hierarchy 'com.enterprise.trading.engine.core.execution' enables massive codebases with millions of lines of code to be organized logically. Google's monorepo has over 2 billion lines of code organized this way.

[click] Critical enterprise imports include dependency injection with CDI, transaction management, validation, and concurrent programming utilities. These are the same imports used by Netflix to serve 230 million subscribers and by Amazon to handle millions of orders per day.

[click] Performance monitoring imports enable real-time observability. Micrometer and OpenTelemetry are used by Uber to monitor 15 million trips daily and by Airbnb to track 4 million bookings. These tools provide the metrics that prevent million-dollar outages.

[click] Professional Javadoc documentation follows enterprise standards. This documentation enables teams of 500+ engineers to collaborate effectively. The compensation and version information reflects the professional standards expected at FAANG companies.

[click] Enterprise annotations enable dependency injection, transaction management, and performance monitoring. These Spring Framework annotations are used by LinkedIn's 800+ million users and by Twitter's real-time tweet processing systems.

[click] The main method includes production-grade argument processing and security audit logging. High-frequency trading systems at firms like Citadel and Two Sigma use this exact pattern to ensure regulatory compliance and system traceability.

# Comment Examples and Best Practices

```java {all|1-3|5-9|11-16|18-20|22-25|all}
// Good: Explains why, not what
// Calculate compound interest for loan processing
double interest = principal * rate * time;

/* 
 * Bad example - obvious comment
 * This adds 1 to count
 */
count++; // Don't do this!

/**
 * Calculates the monthly payment for a loan
 * @param principal The loan amount in rupees
 * @param rate Annual interest rate (as decimal)
 * @param years Loan term in years
 * @return Monthly payment amount
 */
public double calculateMonthlyPayment(double principal, double rate, int years) {
    // Convert annual rate to monthly and years to months
    double monthlyRate = rate / 12;
    int totalMonths = years * 12;
    
    // Apply loan payment formula
    return principal * (monthlyRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, totalMonths)) 
                    / (Math.pow(1 + monthlyRate, totalMonths) - 1);
}
```

# Java Coding Conventions

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

## 📝 Naming Conventions

**Classes:**
```java
public class StudentRecord { }     // ✅ PascalCase
public class student_record { }    // ❌ Wrong
```

**Methods & Variables:**
```java
int studentAge;                    // ✅ camelCase
void calculateGPA() { }           // ✅ camelCase
int Student_Age;                  // ❌ Wrong
```

**Constants:**
```java
public static final int MAX_SIZE = 100;  // ✅ UPPER_CASE
public static final int maxSize = 100;   // ❌ Wrong
```

</div>

<div>

## 🏗️ Structure Conventions

**Indentation:**
```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {  // 4 spaces
        if (condition) {                      // 4 spaces
            System.out.println("Hello");     // 4 spaces
        }
    }
}
```

**Braces:**
```java
// ✅ Correct (K&R style)
if (condition) {
    statement;
}

// ❌ Avoid (Allman style)
if (condition) 
{
    statement;
}

# Main Method Variations

## 🔄 Different Main Method Signatures

```java
// Standard main method (most common)
public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Program logic
}

// Alternative valid signatures
public static void main(String args[]) {
    // C-style array declaration
}

public static void main(String... args) {
    // Variable arguments (varargs)
}

// All modifiers are interchangeable
static public void main(String[] args) {
    // Order doesn't matter
}

final public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Can add final modifier
}

public static synchronized void main(String[] args) {
    // Can add synchronized modifier
}
```

## ⚠️ Invalid Main Method Signatures

```java
// ❌ Wrong return type
public static int main(String[] args) { }

// ❌ Wrong parameter type
public static void main(int[] args) { }

// ❌ Missing static
public void main(String[] args) { }

// ❌ Missing public
static void main(String[] args) { }

// ❌ Wrong parameter count
public static void main() { }
```

# Import Statements and CLASSPATH

## 📚 Import Statement Types

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">

<div>

## 🔍 Import Categories

**Single Type Import:**
```java
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.time.LocalDate;
```

**On-Demand Import:**
```java
import java.util.*;  // All classes in util package
import java.io.*;    // All classes in io package
```

**Static Import:**
```java
import static java.lang.Math.PI;
import static java.lang.Math.sqrt;
import static java.lang.System.out;

// Now can use directly
double area = PI * radius * radius;
double hypotenuse = sqrt(a*a + b*b);
out.println("Result: " + result);
```

</div>

<div>

## ⚡ Import Best Practices

<v-clicks>

- **Prefer specific imports** over wildcard
- **Avoid unused imports** (IDE warnings)
- **Group related imports** logically
- **Use static imports** sparingly

</v-clicks>

<div v-click="5">

**Well-Organized Imports:**

# Troubleshooting Common Issues

<div class="space-y-6">

<div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
<h3 class="font-bold text-red-700 text-xl mb-4">❌ Class Name Mismatch Error</h3>

**Error Message:**
```
error: class HelloWorld is public, should be declared in a file named HelloWorld.java
```

**Problem:**
```java
// File: Welcome.java
public class HelloWorld {  // ❌ Class name doesn't match filename
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

**Solutions:**
1. Rename file to match class: `HelloWorld.java`
2. Or rename class to match file: `public class Welcome`
3. Or remove `public` modifier: `class HelloWorld`

</div>

<div class="bg-orange-50 p-6 rounded-lg">
<h3 class="font-bold text-orange-700 text-xl mb-4">❌ Package Declaration Issues</h3>

**Error Message:**
```
error: package edu.gtu.ict does not exist
```

**Problem & Solution:**
```java
// ❌ Wrong: File in wrong directory
package edu.gtu.ict;  // But file is in root directory

// ✅ Correct: Create proper directory structure
src/
└── edu/
    └── gtu/
        └── ict/
            └── Student.java
```

**Compilation:**
