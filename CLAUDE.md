# Claude Development Notes

## 🤖 AUTONOMOUS DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM - OPERATIONAL!

**Status**: ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL** - True autonomous development with Claude CLI & Gemini CLI

### 🚀 Quick Start Autonomous Development
```bash
# Start with Claude (default)
./autonomous start

# Start with Gemini
./autonomous start --provider=gemini

# Switch providers
./autonomous provider --provider=claude
./autonomous provider --provider=gemini

# Check status
./autonomous status

# View dashboard
./autonomous dashboard

# Stop autonomous development
./autonomous stop
```

### 🎯 Autonomous Capabilities
- 🧠 **Auto-Plans Features** - Analyzes codebase, proposes improvements
- 🐛 **Auto-Hunts Bugs** - Continuously scans and fixes issues  
- 🔧 **Auto-Improves Quality** - Refactors code, adds tests, updates docs
- ⚡ **Auto-Optimizes Performance** - Identifies and resolves bottlenecks
- 🔒 **Auto-Enhances Security** - Scans vulnerabilities, applies fixes
- 🔀 **Auto-Manages PRs** - Creates detailed pull requests autonomously
- 🤖 **Multi-LLM Support** - Choose between Claude CLI and Gemini CLI

**See `AUTONOMOUS_README.md` for complete documentation.**

## 🎯 Claude's Specializations
Claude handles complex, creative development tasks:
- **Feature Planning & Development**
- **Bug Hunting & Analysis** 
- **Security Audits**
- **Code Refactoring**
- **Documentation Writing**
- **Architectural Design**

## 🌿 Git Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
- **`master`** → Production-ready code, protected branch
- **`dev`** → Main development branch for integration testing
- **`feature/*`** → Individual feature development branches
- **`bugfix/*`** → Bug fix branches 
- **`hotfix/*`** → Critical production fixes

### Workflow
1. **Development**: Work on `dev` branch or create feature branches from `dev`
2. **Integration**: Merge feature branches to `dev` for testing
3. **Release**: Merge `dev` to `master` when features are stable and tested
4. **Hotfixes**: Create from `master`, merge to both `master` and `dev`

### Autonomous System
- Autonomous development now works on `dev` branch by default
- Creates feature branches automatically: `autonomous/[task-type]-[timestamp]`
- PRs target `dev` branch for review before merging to `master`
